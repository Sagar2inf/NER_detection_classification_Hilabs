HOSPITAL COURSE and OUTCOME : 
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading . 
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on 1/6/0004 which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -> cypher stented successfully . 
He had occasional ventricular extopyon telemetry but no further recurrence of ventricular tachycardia . 
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 . 
I have explained to him that he may have developed some glucose intolerance and that , in the first instance , he should see his Primary Care Physician and attempt dietary control . 
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site . 
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex . 
I have instructed him to see his PCP if it does not improve in a few days or if he develops fevers . 
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter . 
He will followup with Dr. Levels in device clinic in 4 weeks . 
I have advised him that he must not drive until he is seena gain in clinic and his device interrogated .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .
Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .
He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .
He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .
He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .

He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .
He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .
There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .
He had no cardiac murmur .
His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .
The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .

Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells .
There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .
The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .
His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .
A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .
There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .
An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .
He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .
He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .
His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .
There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .
Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .
Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .
The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .
The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .
He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .
They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .
No autopsy was obtained .

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
06/22/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram times two .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
ABDOMEN :
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .
She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. Mielke and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

At the hospital , she was started on Rocephin and Levaquin for a right lower lobe pneumonia seen on chest x-ray .
She continued to have increasing respiratory distress with hypoxia .
She was also significantly tachypneic .
At this time , repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates consistent with ARDS .

EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals , borderline LVH .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , the patient had what appeared to be acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community - acquired pneumonia .
She was maintained on a ventilator and ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol .
For antibiotic coverage of her pneumonia , she was started on Levaquin , ceftriaxone , and vancomycin .
Over the next two days after admission , the patient 's vent settings were gradually weaned , and she was extubated two days after being transferred to this hospital .
After extubation , the patient was oxygenating well on face mask .
She did continue to have a persistent fairly severe cough ; however , her cough was weak due to abdominal muscle pain from repeated coughing .
The cough was mostly nonproductive .
The patient was breathing comfortably .
As there was no identified bacterial pathogen on any cultures , the patient was continued on the triple antibiotics for first several days of the hospitalization .
She was also on round-the-clock Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers .
Once the patient was transferred out of the ICU and after extubation , the antibiotics were gradually narrowed .
The vancomycin and Levaquin were discontinued after approximately four days in the hospital .
The ceftriaxone was discontinued after four days in the hospital , and the patient was to continue on Levaquin .
The patient had gradual improvement in her oxygenation .
Pain control :
The patient had fairly significant abdominal pain secondary to persistent cough .
She was started on a regimen of MS Contin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain .
This helped her somewhat though she has continued to have difficulty coughing due to the pain .
Tylenol and ibuprofen were also added for better control .
Transaminitis :
The patient was noted to have mild transaminitis on admission .
However , this was felt to be due to her significant infection .
This should continue to be followed as an outpatient to assure that it returns back to normal .
Anemia :
The patient 's reticulocyte count showed inadequate production .
Iron studies showed a mixed picture with decreased iron and decreased iron to TIBC ratio suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia , but also normal to high MCV .
B12 was noted to be low and the patient was given an injection of IM B12 while in the hospital .
She was also started on iron supplementation .
Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on Synthroid for her chronic hypothyroidism .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
The patient was discharged home with services .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Good .

Community-acquired pneumonia .
Acute respiratory distress syndrome .
Iron-deficiency anemia .
Hypothyroidism .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
House diet .
No added salt .
Low saturated fat .
Low cholesterol .
ACTIVITY :
As tolerated .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
Negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .
The patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient &apos;s Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sternal wound infection .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Infected aortic graft .
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
09/02/98 sternal debridement .
Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
Primary closure of wound .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .
At that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .
As the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .

FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .
Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :

regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .
Extremities :
the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .
The patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .
Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .
The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .
After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
This was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .
The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .
The graft used was a homograft .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .
The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .
The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
The patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .
The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .
The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .
The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .
Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
The patient 's condition continued to be improved .
Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .
In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Diet :
High calorie , high protein .
The patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .
The patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .
The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .
The patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .
The patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .

7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .
8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .
9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .
The patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .
The patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .
The patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .
The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .
Dr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .

Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .
Albuterol inhaler .
Lipitor , 20 daily .
Prozac , 60 daily .
Flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .
Atrovent , two puffs qid .
Ditropan , 5 mg tid .
Colace , 100 mg tid .

Tongue was midline .
The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
There was only minimal movement on the left side .
On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .
AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 .
Thyroid function tests were normal .
Troponin I was 0.05 .
Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .
PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .
A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 .

On admission was remarkable for an abdomen which was soft and non-tender .
There was a pulsatile mass felt in the right upper quadrant near the midline .
He had dopplerable lower extremity pulses on the left and on the right , they were palpable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted and taken to the Operating Room the next day on 12/24/09 where patient underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
In his post-operative course , patient was sent to the unit and was put on perioperative Vancomycin .
Post-operatively , patient was found to have frequent aberrant atrial premature beats and some rare ventricular premature beats .
His lungs were found to have decreased breath sounds with a question of fluid overload .
There was a question of whether to start him on Quinidine versus beta blockers .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinetic and akinetic areas throughout the left and right ventricle .
Patient was loaded with Quinidine and then started on a maintenance dose .
Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm once on Quinidine .
Patient was discharged from the unit on 12/30/09 and was sent to the floor .
His digoxin was found to be elevated so his Digoxin was held for four days while levels slowly came down .
Patient was restarted on Digoxin just prior to discharge .
Patient also was found to have elevated LDH , alkaline phosphatase , and amylase prior to admission .
Lipase was within normal limits .
Ultrasound was obtained of the biliary tree which demonstrated no abnormalities .
Patient was also found to have several complaints of awaking in the middle of the night with tachypnea and some bilateral chest pain associated with breathing .
Serial EKG and CK were obtained which were negative .
A chest X-Ray demonstrated some pulmonary edema .
An arterial blood gas at that time showed pO2 of 68 , saturation of 95% , a pH of 7.5l , pCO2 of 37 , a bicarbonate of 37 , and a pCO2 of 3l with a +7 base .

He was watched after his initial diagnosis , but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic .
After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90% involvement of his intratrabecular space .
He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan .
After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state .
However , he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy .
He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08/22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed .
He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest , and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation .
His most recent bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of intratrabecular space involvement .
Recent CT scan showed no significant lymphadenopathy .
The spleen was within normal limits .

He improved clinically with defervescence , decreased white blood cell count to 10,000 with resolution of left shift , and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam .
An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing , primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left , consistent with C. difficile colitis .
The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia , however , was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future .
The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated .
He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge .
2. Azotemia .
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 .
Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration .
With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12/1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient .
The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess .
3. Mental status .
The patient was alert and oriented throughout the admission ; however , by personality , he is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .
He was written for Haldol 1 mg p.o.b.i.d. p.r.n. to help with this problem .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Medications on transfer include multivitamin 1 tablet p.o. q.d. ; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Ventolin inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ; Vancomycin 125 mg p.o. q.i.d. times seven days ; calcium carbonate 1250 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Lotrimin cream to groin b.i.d. p.r.n. ; O2 at four liters per minute ; and Haldol 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DATE : 
07/04/94 
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : 
Mitral stenosis . 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 
Tricuspid insufficiency , atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary hypertension . 
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 
04/22/94 , mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve reconstruction . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
This 68 year old female had rheumatic fever in the past , and has had chronic atrial fibrillation . 
She has had progressive heart failure and an evaluation demonstrated worsening mitral stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension . 
Because of her deteriorating status , she underwent prior cardiac catheterization , which confirmed severe mitral stenosis with secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation due to pulmonary hypertension . 
She was referred for valve surgery . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY is remarkable for chronic lung disease due to smoking . 
She had undergone a previous nasal arterial embolization for treatment of recurrent epistaxis . 
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 . 
Her MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Coumadin , digoxin , 0.125 , qD , Lasix , 40 , q.i.d. , and Vanceril inhaler . 
PERTINENT EXAMINATION demonstrated mild elevation of her jugular venous pulse , with prominent V-waves , and systolic and diastolic murmurs . 
Peripheral pulses were all intact , and there was venous stasis changes on her legs , with some edema . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
The patient was brought to the Operating Room , on April 22 . 
She underwent a mitral valve replacement , utilizing a 27 mm . 
St. Jude prosthesis , and tricuspid valve reconstruction by ring anuloplasty . 
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with good hemodynamics . 
She initially awoke after surgery , with good hemodynamics . 
She was transiently in sinus rhythm , but atrial fibrillation recurred . 
She was extubated on the third postoperative day , and was initially slightly agitated and confused , largely due to an Intensive Care Unit psychosis . 
She continued to improve , with mobilization of fluid . 
She was initially noted to have a slow ventricular response in atrial fibrillation , but this gradually improved over time . 
She was initially noted to be somewhat anemic , and received transfusions . 
Coumadin was restarted , and her anticoagulation came into range . 
She was ultimately discharged with a heart rate in the 90 's , and with resolving edema and a clear chest . 
Her MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Lasix , 40 , b.i.d. , potassium , 20 mEq. , b.i.d. , iron , and folic acid replacement , and Coumadin .

DISCHARGE DATE :
11-06-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral stenosis
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tricuspid regurgitation , heart failure , chronic atrial fibrillation , chronic ventricular ectopy , chronic obstructive lung disease .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization 11/03 .
OTHER PROCEDURE :
Pulmonary function test 11/04 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager .
She has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents .
She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 .
She has now had progressive heart failure .
A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini .
She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only &quot; two puffs &quot; per day .
She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet .
There is no family history of heart disease .
She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a &quot; tumor &quot; .
She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 .
Neck veins distended .
Carotids normal .
Chest clear .
Apical impulse not palpable .
Right ventricular heave .
S1 normal .
S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 .
No S3 or opening snap .
Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Diastolic rumble at the apex .
Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged .
Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses .
Superficial varicose veins .
No edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction .
Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission .
Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation .
There was no tricuspid valve gradient .
Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 .
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient .
There was little or no aortic valve gradient .
Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 .
Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent .
There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium .
There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation .
There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending .
FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 .
Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis .
He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally .
The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave .
The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission .
The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure .
This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave .
In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .
Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past .
DISCHARGE REGIMEN :
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis on Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Partial embolization of blood supply to nose , 8/22 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old female has rheumatic heart disease .
Mitral and possibly tricuspid valve surgery is scheduled for Labor Day by Dr. Riemund C. Kennedy .
Her history is detailed in the discharge summary of August 10 of this year .
She is admitted now for a neuro-interventional radiology procedure to decrease the likelihood of epistaxis on Coumadin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Chest was clear .
Right neck and right groin catheterization sites were benign .
No edema .
Examination was otherwise unchanged .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit was 42 , PT was 10 , potassium was 3.6 , BUN was 29 , creatinine was 1.4 , blood sugar was 111 .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , right ventricular hypertrophy , right axis deviation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The interventional neuro-radiology procedure was performed by Dr. A Skizeis , on August 22 , via the right femoral artery .
The right internal maxillary artery supply to the nasal mucosa was embolized .
The left external carotid artery was occluded at its origin , with collaterals from the internal carotid artery .
Thus , embolization on the left side was not possible .
The patient received Coumadin , 10 mg. , on the evening following the procedure , and is discharged the next day .
Her prothrombin time will be rechecked on August 27 by her primary care physician , Dr. Naka Gift .
Once her prothrombin time is in therapeutic range , she will be observed for epistaxis .
She will take her last dose of Coumadin on September 1 in anticipation of cardiac surgery .
If her prothrombin time does not come into therapeutic range promptly , then surgery may be delayed .

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
1. HYPONATREMIA , 1-13-94 .
2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , 1-14-94 .
3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER .
4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .
UTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .

She had menarche at age 15 .
She used the pill for five years in the past .
She is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .
She has a history of easy bruis ability .
She is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
MS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Married with two children .
She worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .
She denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A cachectic white female .
T 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .
HEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .
Neck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear .
Chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .
Cardiovascular - Normal .
Abdomen - Normal .
There was no HSM .
Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen .
It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .
PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .
ALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .
Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .
UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CML .
OTHER DIAGNOSES :
1. STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
2. INTRAPARENCHYMAL BLEED .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .

At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .

LABORATORY DATA :
Coagulation profile notable for a PT 18 , PTT 36.7 and an INR of 2.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and begun on cefotetan and Flagyl , as well as heparin .
Her INR dropped to 1.6 prior to surgery , and her PTT was in the mid 80s prior to surgery .
She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day # 3 , 10/28/97 .
At that time , she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair . ( A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note ) .
She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .
She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells .
Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day # 2 .
This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 .
Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells , her hematocrit returned to 33 , and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion , returned to 34 .
Otherwise , her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum .
Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day # 3 .
On postoperative day # 1 , the patient was restarted on 2 mg of Coumadin .
However , due to the episode of bleeding on postoperative day # 2 , the Coumadin was held for two consecutive days , and then restarted on postoperative day # 4 .
At this time , she is given 3 mg and was gradually increased to her regular regimen of 4 mg alternating with 3 mg.
The patient &apos;s INR had dropped to 1.7 at the time of operation , and remained in this range initially , but began to rise to 2.0 with her Coumadin dosing .
At the time of discharge , it was 1.9 , for which she received 4 mg.
On the next day , it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing .
This was postoperative day # 6 , at which time she is ready for discharge .
The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable , with perioperative ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1 .
She had some initial nausea but had no emesis .
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1 , and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3 .
She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5 .
She also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up .
For this reason , her normal Lopressor and Norvasc were held .
It was felt that this was re-equalibration after being sedentary and mostly in bed following the operation .
She had some slight headaches which resolved with Tylenol , and the dizziness resolved as well .
She was ready for discharge on postoperative day # 6 .
Her wound remained benign and was healing nicely at the time of discharge .

Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .
Reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :

A chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .
Admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .
Her cholesterol was 350 here .
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg. PO q.d. , Folic Acid 1 mg. PO q.d. , Ciprofloxacin 500 mg.

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .
The SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .
Lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .
Hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .
The MCV is 88 .
The prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .
The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .
The CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .
The urine sodium was 147 .
The serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .
An I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .
The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .
Chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .

normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
02/13/1990
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Ankle surgery times two on the right .
Pilonidal cyst removal .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included Naprosyn .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
HABITS :
The patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a 75-pack-year history of smoking .
He has a history of drinking which he discontinued in May .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

SEVERE BLUNT ABDOMINAL TRAUMA .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
7-2-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
7-30-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Grade II / V laceration of liver ,
2. rupture of left renal vein ,
3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,
4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,
5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .
The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .
He was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .
He had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .
Intravenous fluids was given .
He was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .
He arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .
Large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .
He had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .
His hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .
The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .
His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .
At laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .
There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .
Control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided &quot; Mattox &quot; maneuvers were performed .
The retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .
This was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .
The vein was divided and suture ligated .
Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .
The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .
The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .
The patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer &apos;s lactate .
An intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .
Intracranial pressures were normal .
That day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .
An arch aortogram was normal .
Over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .
The patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .
He was returned to the operating room on July 4 .
Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .
Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .
Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .
Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .
The patient &apos;s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .
However , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .
He was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient &apos;s course .
Vancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .
He was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .
Total parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .
Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .
The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .
It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .
The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .
He was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .
Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .
There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .
The subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .
On July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .
On July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .
His blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,
2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,

3. EPISODE OF PULMONARY EDEMA
4. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of prior anterior myocardial infarction and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
The course had multiple complications requiring pressors .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 15 years with no retinopathy or foot lesions .
(2) Bilateral cataracts .
(3) In 1967 he had an orchiopexy for undescended testicle .
(4) Coronary artery disease as above .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , Capoten 25 mg p.o. q.8h. , NPH insulin 28 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m. , Regular insulin 4 units q.a.m. and 4 units q.p.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. day , digoxin 0.25 mg.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He lives with his two brothers and is on disability .
He has a ten pack year history of smoking , quit in 1990 .
He does not drink alcohol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
His mother and father both died secondary to myocardial infarction .
One of his brothers has had a myocardial infarction .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 100.3 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure 100/78 , respiratory rate 16 , and an oxygen saturation of 96% on two liters .
NECK :
No jugular venous distention .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation with no wheezes or rales .
CARDIOVASCULAR :
Regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds and no murmurs .
ABDOMEN :
Benign .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema with 2+ pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 25 and creatinine 1.4 .
White count 6 and hematocrit 41.5 .
PT 14.1 with an INR of 1.4 , PTT 36.7 .
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates and no pulmonary edema .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 with normal intervals .
He had flat T waves in I and aVL , which were unchanged from previous ECG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 .
At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 .
His coronary arteries revealed an 80% stenosis and a large OM .
The dominant left circumflex was occluded with left-to-left filling .
He also had a 50% LAD stenosis , a 100% large DT stenosis and a nondominant RCA with left RCA collaterals .
It was felt that this cardiac catheterization was not significantly changed from his previous catheterization .
Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction .
It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .
Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .
Neck veins are not distended .
Respiratory rate 12 .
Carotids :
no bruits .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological examination non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .
Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
12/05/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
12/17/93
CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient &apos;s increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient &apos;s prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient &apos;s rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

Nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities are present as well .
Otherwise , the axis is normal and the intervals are normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient &apos;s gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gait disorder .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
Her Doxepin has recently been increased .
She is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
ALLERGIES :
Quinine gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .
She was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .
There is a history of childhood abuse .
She does not drink .
She is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .
Her thyroid was within normal limits .
There were no carotid or cervical bruits .
She had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Her abdomen was benign .
Her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
Mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
Her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
Her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
Visual fields were full to confrontation .
Her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
Her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
Her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
There was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
Her saccades were normal .
Facial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .
Her tongue , uvula and palate were midline .
Shoulder shrug was 5/5 power .
Motor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .
There was no drift .
There was normal bulk and tone .
She had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .
Sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
Reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
There was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .
Coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
On standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
Her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
LABORATORY DATA :
Were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .
Her coagulation parameters were normal .
Head CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
She will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.' s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient 's fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient 's electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.' s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to El Hospital , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient 's p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient 's p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient 's urinary obstruction will be addressed .

The patient his undergoing a TTE prior to discharge to rule out a thrombus .
His TTE showed EF 45-50% , moderate cLVH , abnormal diastolic function , moderate MR , moderate TR and severe LAE .
THere was a question of ionfiltrative cardiomyopathy , and the patient underwent abdominal fat pad biopsy to assess for amyloidosis .
He also currently has an SPEP / UPEP/Beta 2 microglobulin / ACE test that are currently pending .
These should be followed up as an outaptient .
He had carotid ultrasound studies 3 months ago that were normal without evidence for stenosis .
2. Renal - cont MWF HD ; electrolytes have been stable .
Perhaps his recent falls are related to orthostatic hypotension after dialysis .
3. CV -The pt has a small area of reversible ischemia on recent MIBI , and has troponins persistently elevated in the setting of his renal disease .
His troponins remained lower than his baseline levels and there was no suspicion of ACS causing syncope .
He continued on his zocor , cozaar and labetalol .
We will now hold his coumadin given his recent falls and bleeding risk .
His aspirin was restarted prior to discharge .
4. Endo - TSH was 4.7 and normal .
5. Heme :
The patient has a macrocytosis .
His B12 level was 418 and normal .
He does have a history of B12 deficiency in the past , and evidence for peripheral neuropathy BLE which may also be contributing to his recent falls . ? EtOH
6. Psych :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65-year-old man with refractory CLL , status post non-myeloblative stem cell transplant approximately nine months prior to admission , and status post prolonged recent Retelk County Medical Center stay for Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , complicated by ARS due to medication toxicity , as well as GVHD and recent CMV infection , readmitted for new fever , increasing creatinine , hepatomegaly and fluid surge spacing , in the setting of hyponatremia .
Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In November , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in July , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in December , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , August , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on November 11 , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week .
Denies cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , neck stiffness , new skin lesions , worsening red petechiae , or increasing sinus symptoms .
Patient reports persistent mild right upper quadrant discomfort , recent poor appetite .

Erythematous nodules on arms at elbows and on right thigh , as previous .
NEUROLOGIC :
Alert and appropriate .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 129 , creatinine 3.0 , BUN 70 , potassium 5.0 , bicarbonate 23 , chloride 99 , ALT 36 , AST 30 , alkaline phosphatase 215 , total bilirubin 1.1 , albumin 2.6 , white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 75 year old Hispanic male with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , status post a right above-knee amputation about five years ago , who reportedly approximately four months ago , he developed a small ulceration in the left great toe , which progressively worsened .
He was seen by a doctor in Arizona and treated with dressing changes and debridement until approximately six weeks ago , when antibiotics were started with Ciprofloxacin .
The patient was seen and it was suggested that he should have an amputation and he decided to come to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for fifteen years .

In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .

Neck was supple with no thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .
Mr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation .
Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .
His blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing .
Carotids were 2+ .
Crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up .
There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .
The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .
LABORATORY DATA :
Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .
The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .
chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
At 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .
The patient was pronounced dead .

She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
acute renal insufficiency .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from Sondi Memorial for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension .
The patient presented to Sondi Memorial on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 .
The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices .
A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen .
The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate .
On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at Sondi Memorial when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough .
He went to Sondi Memorial where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime .
His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated .
The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability .
An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .
Blood cultures x two sent off with no growth .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with flat creatine kinases and he was sent to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for further work up .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on 5-2-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on 5-2-98 , at 4:55 p.m.
Family and primary carephysician informed .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Carotid stenosis .
2. Aortic stenosis .
3. Coronary artery disease .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .

IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION :
Impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history , dyspnea on exertion , increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left sided spastic hemiparesis , status post surgical correction of C-1 , C-2 dural AVM .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C-1 to C-2 dural AVM in January , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .
She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .
She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .
The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .
She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .
As of the beginning of September , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .
Functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .
Over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .
She is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .
Her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .
She has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .
She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .
Over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .
The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .
This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .

Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT .
The patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .
She will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .
Arrangements will be made for radiation therapy to the right neck and right iliac crest .
The prognosis for rehabilitation potential is guarded .

The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view . 
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis . 
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery . 
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation . 
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation . 
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone . 
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 . 
The patient had no further angina . 
On 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study . 
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris . 
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall . 
This was consistent with scar . 
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone .

On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &apos;d to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB&apos;s .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
HABITS :
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
There was no splenomegaly .
The femoral pulses were diminished .
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &apos;d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &apos;s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &apos;s compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .
He was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .
On 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
2) Recent PCP .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .
On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

Electrocardiogram revealed Q-waves in leads II , III and AVF .
A computerized tomography scan revealed right lower occipital low-density area .
Head magnetic resonance imaging study and magnetic resonance imaging angiogram obtained on May 11 , 1995 , revealed subacute right lateral occipital lobe infarction and decreased flow related enhancement in the left posterior communicating artery with respect to that on the right .
The right suggested decreased flow .
Carotid noninvasives revealed minimal carotid disease .
Transcranial Dopplers :
normal posterior and anterior circulation .
Holter electrocardiogram :
no significant arrhythmias .
Electroencephalogram :
normal study .
Visual field testing :
small wedge-shaped visual field defect in right eye , suggesting retinal lesion .
Echocardiogram revealing segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving inferoseptal , inferior and posterior segments at the base and mid ventricular level .

LABORATORY DATA :
White blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , MCV 81 .
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , BUN 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , AST 49 , ALT33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 140/100 , phosphorus 94 , weight 181 lb .
Head , neck :
unremarkable .
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Cardiac :
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological :
Nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
MCV was 85 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric carcinoma
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
hypothyroidism following near total thyroidectomy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
On 1/12/92 near total gastrectomy with retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy , portal node dissection , repair of ventral hernia , and needle jejunostomy tube placement .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
None
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Tikrhalt is an 86 year old female , previously healthy , who presents with a 3 month history of dysphagia .
A subsequent workup including upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal computerized tomography scan suggested the presence of a gastric mass .
Endoscopy with biopsy revealed gastric carcinoma , poorly differentiated , within the body of the stomach along the greater curvature .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. Ko for a possible resection of this carcinoma .
She reports a 10 pound weight loss over the past several months .
She denies any abdominal pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for an appendectomy in the distant past , cholecystectomy in the past , history of of Cesarean section in the past and a history of near total thyroidectomy for nodular goiter in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Her only medication is Thyrolar for her relative hypothyroidism following resection .
There is a question of an allergy to Tylenol .
She denies any history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease or peptic ulcer disease .
Interestingly , she reports that both her mother and father died of stomach carcinoma .
She is a former smoker , and drinks alcohol occasionally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is an elderly but spry white female in no acute distress .
Her sclera were nonicteric .
Her oropharynx was clear .
Her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her cardiac examination was unremarkable .
Examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses .
There were multiple well healed surgical scars .
She was guaiac negative .
There was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted .
Her pulses were intact throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 139 , potassium 3.7 and BUN of 19 .
Her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 .
Her Bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively .
Her alkaline phosphatase was 134 .
Her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes .
Chest X-Ray was unremarkable .
The assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma , admitted for resection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile .
On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .
The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable .
Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing Vivonex T.E.N.
The patient tolerated this without difficulty .
The patient 's nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly .
She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to .
Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance .
As mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge .
She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect .
These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach .
Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes .
The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma .
The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well .
On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection .
She was started empirically on Bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation .
She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Bactrim , single strength , one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days , initiated 9/27/92 , Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.day , Ferrous Gluconate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
LESS , LIESEANALE
UNIT NUMBER :
589-25-50
ADMISSION DATE :
12/16/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/16/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
11. Abdominal abscesses .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatocellular carcinoma , and hepatitis C .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Liver transplant .
Native hepatectomy .
Re-exploration for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .
PAST MEDICAL and
SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Significant for normal head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam with no scleral icterus .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , his lungs were clear .
He had no appreciable ascites .
He did have clubbing and palmar erythema with bilateral ankle edema .
He was Neurologically intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
bilirubin to be .6 .
SGOT of 80 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 15 , 1992 .

Urinary tract infection , E. Coli .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
MRI / MRA .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram , neurovascular ultrasound .
HISTORY :
Patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .
He had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .
At his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .
He also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .
His history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on Dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression &apos;92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .
His temperatureis 98.9 .
His pressure is 150/90 .
Rate 76 .
Respirations 16 .
He was edentulous .
He had mild copper wiring .
He has a I / VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
Heart sounds were normal and regular .
Breath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .
He had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .
Abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .
He had 2+ carotids , no bruits .
He had gynecomastia .
Rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .
Extremities :
1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .
He had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .
His right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.
His hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .
Reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .
His tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .
He occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .
Mental state :
He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .
He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .
Coordination :
his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .
He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .
Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .
On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .
Follow up will be with Dr. Tvi Fine of Neurology , and Dr. Doll Grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Respiratory failure .
Congestive heart failure .
Right lower lobe pneumonia .
Atonic bladder with suprapubic catheter .
Anxiety .
Coronary artery disease .
History of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .
He was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .
The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .
He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Associated medical problems include :
1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .
2. Anxiety .
3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .
4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day .
2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
3. Xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs .
4. Brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
5. Combivent 3 puffs four times per day .
6. Aerobid three puffs twice a day .
7. Sorbitol 30 cc every other day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress .
He had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 .
He was in moderate respiratory distress .
His temperature was 98F .
He had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam .
Neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses .
Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases .
There were no wheezes or rhonchi .
Heart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 .
Abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable .
Rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative .
Neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male .
He moved all extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 .
Blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .
Urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient &apos;s respiratory status was stable .
I think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .
He needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .
3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day .
4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute .
5. Levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until 4/12/99 .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Mass was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from Vassdiysey Medical Center for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. Mass had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .

His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in January 1994 , and August 1994 .
On his current admission , the patient was admitted to Free Medical Center .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
A computerized tomography scan done on 4/16/95 showed a large &quot; pseudocyst &quot; .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
In general , confused white man , in mild distress .
Vital signs :
Temperature was 102 , heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate was 22 , blood pressure was 113/63 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat was benign .
His neck was supple .
Lungs :
Rales at the right base , bilateral decreased breath sounds at the bases .
Cor :
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no extra heart sounds , abdomen distended with an epigastric mass noted , mildly tender to palpation , no guarding .
Bowel sounds were present .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
A perisplenic effusion was noted which appeared to communicate with the lesser sac collection .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On 4/17/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .

History of coronary artery disease with status post two-vessel CABG in 1986 , also he was treated for congestive heart failure , hypertension , aortic valve replacement , and mitral valve replacement with St. Jude &apos;s valve in 09/2001 , atrial fibrillation , history of prior GI bleed requiring blood transfusions during which he also had a colonoscopy on 05/2003 which demonstrated no neoplasia and scattered diverticuli .
The patient also , following his first GI bleed , had an EEG done in 07/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
Included Lasix , Lopressor , Coumadin , Diovan , torsemide , Flomax , Protonix , Senekot , potassium , vitamin C , iron , and a multivitamin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for no tobacco , no alcohol .
He has a wife with Alzheimer &apos;s who lives in a skilled-nursing facility .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a BUN and creatinine of 78 , 1.7 ; for a sodium , potassium 139 and 3.6 ; chloride and bicarb 108 , 21 .
White count 7 , hematocrit 24.2 , platelet count was 183 .
His INR was also 3.4 .
PTT was 55 .
His EKG was notable for right bundle branch block , left axis deviation , but was in sinus rhythm .
His UA had 10-17 white blood cells ; trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 .
His chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions .
OTHER NOTALBE LABS :
Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 .
ASSESSMENT :
At that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
DISPOSITION :
Was discharged on 11/16/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 .
He was asked to continue on his Nexium , iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His final medications on discharge were as follows :
Aspirin 325 , he was restarted on a PPI , also on iron , vitamin C , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d .
Of note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , Coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , Diovan .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his PCP as well as to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic and Dr. Gilbert .

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
08/01/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .
2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .
3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .
2 ) Hypertension .
3 ) Status post hysterectomy .
4 ) Status post appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
2 ) Lasix p.r.n.
3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .
4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5 ) Thiamine .
6 ) Lasix p.r.n.
7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
8 ) Folic acid .
9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .
10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Insulin sliding scale .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is divorced .
She has two children .
She recently retired as a clerical worker .
She denies any tobacco .
She has only social alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .
Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .
Brother has coronary artery disease .
There is no family history of hematologic problems .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient &apos;s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient &apos;s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .
After this , the patient &apos;s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient &apos;s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .
FOLLOW-UP :
1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .
3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .
4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .
6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .
7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .
8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15 , 1999 at 12:30 PM .

ADMISSION DATE :
12/11/2003
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/08/2004
The patient has a known history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
He is admitted at this time because of significant GI bleeding .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Significant for fatigue and increased abdominal discomfort .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION :
Insulin , Celexa , Protonix , Ambien and Pancreas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs showed his blood pressure to be slightly decreased at 120/60 , pulse 64 , respirations 16 , temperature 98.8 , O2 sat 95 .
HEENT :
Evidence of anemia with being pale , but anicteric , no oral lesions .
Neck supple .
Lungs clear .
Back without CVA or spinal tenderness .
Heart regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Bowel sounds positive , soft , mildly tender in the epigastrium without hepatosplenomegaly , mass or tenderness .
Extremities :
Trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing .
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 20.5 , after having been 32 one week earlier .
ASSESSMENT :
The assessment was that he had a GI bleed .
He was transfused and then evaluated by GI .
Endoscopy showed multiple angio ectasias throughout the stomach .
He received multiple treatments for this over the succeeding weeks .
In addition , he was transfused .
His platelet count was maintained with platelet transfusion as necessary .
He was treated with Octreotide to try to slow down the bleeding .
Despite all these measures , his bleeding was never totally controlled .
He then had an angiogram with Gel foam to try to control his GI bleed .
Again , this was unsuccessful .
At that point he had a change in mental status and was no longer responsive .
Given this , the decision was made to make his care comfort measures only .
At this point , he was made comfort measures and expired comfortably .
The cause of death was a combination of GI bleeding felt to be ultimately related to his known metastatic pancreatic cancer .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 - year-old male with a history of hypertension , remote tobacco abuse , chronic renal insufficiency , and a history of a TIA who was in his usual state of health until five nights prior to admission when he awoke at midnight with severe epigastric pain radiating to both arms .
He also had bilateral arm numbness .
The symptoms were associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath but no nausea or vomiting .
After approximately one hour , he presented to the Bristol County Tuberculosis Hospital Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Campus where he ruled in for a non-ST elevation MI with a CK of 438 with a peak CK MB of 19.8 and troponin that peaked at 10.2 .
He was started on nitrates there as well as heparin and Integrelin and remained pain-free .
He denied any history of similar symptoms in the past and has had no prior history of angina or myocardial infarction .
The patient was subsequently transferred to Youville Hospital for cardiac catheterization .
At the time of transfer , he was initially admitted to the CMI Service after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed a long LAD lesion that was angioplastied without stent placement , and a total occlusion of the RCA with collaterals .
He subsequently became hypotensive and bradycardiac in the Catheterization Laboratory which responded to IV fluids , dopamine , Atropine , and he was then transferred to the CCU for further monitoring .
He had a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram done in the Cardiac Catheterization laboratory without evidence of an effusion .
A Swan was also placed .
There were no stents deployed at all throughout the catheterization .
By the time he was admitted , he was off pressors and hemodynamically stable and pain-free .

He had no evident edema .
He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally .
Neurologic :
He was alert and oriented times three , moving all extremities .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the CBC revealed a white count of 7.4 , hematocrit 39.7 , and platelets of 217,000 .
Serum chemistries revealed a sodium of 135, potassium 4.0 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 29 , creatinine 1.6 , and glucose of 111 .
The initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 71 with a normal axis and evidence of first-degree AV block with prolonged PR interval of 238 milliseconds .
He also had a widened QRS of 153 milliseconds , an old right bundle branch block , and no acute ST or T wave changes .
The EKG was prior to catheterization and the one post PTCA was no different .
He had a bedside echocardiogram done in the Catheterization Laboratory which showed normal LV wall thickness and normal LV cavity size .
There was no evidence of effusion .
It was difficult to assess free wall motion .
Cardiac catheterization revealed a totally occluded RCA with collaterals , an 80 percent LAD lesion extending distally which was angioplastied but no stent was placed .
Hemodynamics :
The right heart catheterization revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 4 , cardiac output of 8 , and cardiac index of 3.8 , he had an RA pressure of 10 , RV pressure of 43/4 , PA pressure of 37/10 .
ASSESSMENT :
This is an 82 - year-old male with a history of prior tobacco use , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , COPD , gastritis , and TIA who initially presented to Braintree with a non-ST elevation MI and Guaiac positive stools , transferred to St. Margaret's Center for Women & Infants for cardiac catheterization with PTCA to mid LAD lesion complicated by hypotension and bradycardia requiring Atropine , IV fluids and transient dopamine possibly secondary to vagal reaction , subsequently transferred to CCU for close monitoring , hemodynamically stable at the time of admission to the CCU .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As summarized above , the patient had a non-ST elevation MI with evidence of an 80 percent mid LAD lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement .
He was initially continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor .
At the time of discharge , his Plavix was held due to Guaiac positive stools and hematocrit drop throughout admission .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram the day after admission showing an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent .
No focal wall motion abnormalities .
He had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath throughout admission .
In regards to his rhythm , he has an underlying right bundle branch block and first-degree AV block which were stable throughout this admission .
He will be followed-up by his cardiologist after discharge .
1. PULMONARY :
He had a history of COPD for which he is on baseline 2 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at home and Albuterol and Atrovent MDI s p.r.n. at home .
He is also on Flovent MDI at home as well .
He was continued on his MDI and was at his baseline 02 requirement throughout admission .
1. RENAL :
He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to hypertension and was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 .
His ACE inhibitor post MI was initially held due to his creatinine .
However , this responded to IV fluids and his ACE inhibitor was restarted at the time of discharge .
He will need close monitoring of his creatinine post discharge in the setting of reinstitution of his ACE inhibitor .
1. GASTROINTESTINAL :
His stools were noted to be Guaiac positive at the outside hospital and there was still concern for possible GI bleed given continued Guaiac positive stools during this admission and a slight drop in his hematocrit from 39 to 33 .
It was felt most appropriate for him to have an outpatient GI workup , and his PCP was contacted and will arrange for outpatient colonoscopy .
His Plavix was held at the time of discharge due to a question of GI bleed and in the setting of not having a stent placed at the time of catheterization .
He was continued on his aspirin , however .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Coronary artery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with 80 percent mid LAD lesion , now status post angioplasty .
Hypertension .
Chronic renal insufficiency .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Guaiac  positive stools .
Anemia .

5. Combivent MDI p.r.n.
6. Toprol XL 100 mg q.d.
DISPOSITION :
At the time of discharge , the patient 's vital signs were stable and he was without complaints .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
He will be discharged to home and was cleared by Physical Therapy .
FOLLOW UP :
He has been scheduled for follow-up with Dr. Martha on 2015-03-25 at 11:00 a.m.

DIS
Admission Date :
09/16/2000
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
11/03/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
RUPTURED PARATHYROID ADENOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .
She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .
They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .
At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .
This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH-BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION :
Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
On transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and retired .
She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is intubated .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 98.6 , 66 .
Right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .
Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .
GENERAL :
She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
NECK :
Edematous .
Trachea was midline .
She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
The superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
LUNGS :
She had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with good bowel sounds .
It was nontender .
It was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
Both were easily reducible .
PULSE :
On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .
Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .
Her gas was 7.47/40/332 .
Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
It was consistent with a hematoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .
This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
There was no active bleeding at the time .
Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .
The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .
She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
This required a chest tube .
Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
In conclusion , by systems :
1. Neuro .
The patient became intermittently agitated .
We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
She responds well to this .
She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .
She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .
She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .
2. Cardiac .
The patient &apos;s blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .
This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .
Her blood pressure responds well to this .
Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .
This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .
Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .
The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
They elected not to inject it with thrombin .
They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
They have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. Respiratory .
At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .
Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
Her right lung field is clear .
Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .
Her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. GI .
The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .
This is her goal .
She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .
Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .
Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .
These have all been negative .
We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. GU .
The patient has had hypernatremia .
She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .
We believe her to still be total body overloaded .
Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .
We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .
This seems to trend her sodium down .
This will need to be monitored closely .
Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. Heme .
As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
She had no problems with this .
At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .
I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .
She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .
7. ID .
At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .
Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .
We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. Tubes , lines , and drains .
The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .
Her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .

DISCHARGE DATE :
05/16/2006
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Chest pain .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Coronary artery disease ; hypertension ; hyperlipidemia ; sleep apnea ; diabetes type 2 .
PROCEDURES :
Adenosine stress test .
Part 1 of a sleep study .
Coronary angiogram .
Chest CT .
Chest x-ray .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD status post non ST elevation MI in 11/17 who presents with chest pain X 48 hours .
He went to Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room .
He has a history of hypertension , diabetes , and high cholesterol .
In 2003 , he had a non ST elevation MI , came to the RWH , and had a cath done , which showed a 40% RCA , which was hazy .
An IVUS was done , and it was felt that it was more severe .
He underwent a PTC stenting of an RCA with a Vision stent , 3 x 18 .
Diagonal 1 also had a 99% stenosis .
There was no other noted disease .
Since then , the patient has occasional chest pain with emotional stress , when he is angry or upset .
Yesterday morning , he developed intermittent substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder that worsened with any activity and any motion of his shoulders .
It progressed over the course of the day requiring less movement .
He also became short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs .
He denies diaphoresis or nausea .
He went to the Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room after trying nitroglycerin at home .
However , his nitroglycerin was old and the script was expired .
In the ER , he received 3 sublingual nitroglycerins and 1 mg of Dilaudid .
After that , he was pain-free .
Lopressor IV was given to control his heart rate .
He also received Lipitor 80 mg , Plavix 300 , heparin IV , integrelin double bolus , followed by a drip .
Apparently once his pain was free , his EKG was noted to have hyperacute T-wave anteriorly without progression .
He was transferred to the Ro Woodma Healthcare for further cardiac care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Diabetes ; hypertension ; hyperlipidemia .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME :
Include Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. every day ; nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.; Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. every day ; Plavix 75 mg p.o. every day ; Avandia 4 mg p.o. every day ; Lipitor 40 mg p.o. every day ; TriCor 145 mg p.o. every day .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He is married .
He does have a lot of anxiety .
Socially he drinks alcohol .
He does not smoke .
He has 2 daughters .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient ruled out for an MI with negative CK X4 and negative troponin X4 .
He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where cath showed top-normal LVEDP at 12 ; no AF ; widely patent RCA stent ; mild CAD in the left coronary artery symptom ; widely patent diagonal 1 at the site of prior PTCA .
He received an Angio-Seal to the right common femoral artery .
He then underwent a CT scan to rule out a PE .
That test was negative .
He underwent lower extremity study to rule out a DVT in both legs .
That was negative .
He was noted to have an episode of desaturation into the 80% range while sleeping .
Pulmonary consult was done , and it was felt that the patient should undergo a formal sleep study , full PFTs , and a repeat CT scan in 1 year to assess for pulmonary nodule that was seen .
However , please note that this nodule has been stable over time .
The patient also complained of intermittent right neck swelling , and recommendations are to consider a CT scan with contrast to evaluate nodes in his neck .
On physical exam today , the patient did not have any swelling , and he states that he did not feel the swelling was present .
The patient underwent an adenosine stress test , where he exercised for 4 minutes , reaching 65% of predicted heart rate .
He did not have chest pain .
EKG was negative for ischemia .
The myocardial perfusion images show no definite evidence of ischemia .
The LV contractile function was normal .
There was mild posterior vasal thinning .
It is not clearly outside normal limits .
He underwent an echocardiogram , which showed an EF of 60% .
There was no evidence of MVP .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
There was no evidence of LA dilatation .
There was no aortic stenosis .
There was trace aortic insufficiency .
The LV cavity size was normal .
The systolic function was within normal limits .
There was no evidence of LV hypertrophy .
There was no obvious segmental wall-motion abnormality .
There was no evidence of pericardial effusion .
The right ventricle was not dilated .
The systolic function was within normal limits .
The patient underwent a sleep study , the first part , which showed that he had 75 respiratory events observed with apnea , hypopnea index of 11 an hour .
The mean heart rate was 68 .
They felt that there was obstruction and possible obstruction to airflow generating some obstructive apnea , as well as partial obstructive events .
They recommended that the patient may benefit from a trial of continuous positive pressure at the bedside .
The patient has been scheduled to have the second part of the sleep study done on June 18 , 2006 , at 8:30 p.m. at RWH in the Esley Community Hospital , 10th floor sleep lab , phone number 133-225-1257 .
Prior to discharge today , he underwent PFTs .
The results of the PFTs are unavailable at the time of this dictation .
Based on all the tests above , it was felt that the patient was stable for discharge home .
His blood pressure was 114 to 123/62 .
Heart rate 69 to 80 .
Room air saturation 96% .
Temperature 97.9 .
Lung sounds clear bilaterally .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Vascular Surgery Service as a same day admission , and taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm , and Anurx modular bifurcated graft was placed , and both common femoral arteries were repaired in the usual fashion .
He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings , in both lower extremities , and both renal arteries were noted to be patent , as were both internal iliac arteries .
His angiogram in the operating room , revealed no evidence of an endo leak .
Postoperatively , his course was relatively uncomplicated .
He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room , which resulted in transient loss of consciousness .
He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus , and had no further complications from this standpoint .
Dr. Rosean Fletcher , of the Cardiology Department was consulted , and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively , perhaps secondary to the epidural , as well as the patient &apos;s Atenolol use .
His Atenolol was held , and he had no further pauses during his stay .
His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak , or graft kinking .
He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively .
However , he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins , extending down into his scrotum .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease for more than twenty years who presented to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 .
She has been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The carotids were normal .
The chest was clear .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The first sound was normal .
The second sound was normally split .
She had no murmurs and no gallops .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
There were prominent Q-waves in AVL , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
On 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .

An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 75 year old righthanded Caucasian female who was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital because of left facial droop and hand weakness after glaucoma laser surgery .
She was transferred to the Sas General Hospital for further evaluation of some weakness in the setting of multiple medical problems .
The patient had o.d. glaucoma surgery , 1400 hours , on May 12th , 1992 .
Soon after surgery , the patient noted her left lower face and hand were weak .
She was brought to the emergency room where she was evaluated and determined to have had a cerebrovascular accident .
She has absolutely no neurologic disease in past .
The review of systems is negative .
However , two days prior to admission , one family member noted that the patient had a transient left facial droop .
A potassium three days prior to surgery was 2.8 , the level being normalized with p.o. kay ciel prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 , no angina before or after .
She had a normal exercise thallium test in 08/89 , per Ona Hospital .
The phone no. at the Ona Hospital is 337-4296 , 936 area code .
# 2. History of M. kansasaii with workup by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital proceeding currently .
# 3. History of breast cancer .
In December 1990 she had a lumpectomy , from left breast , and XRT x 35 .
No axillary dissection was done because she was status post MI .

Rectal tone was normal , guaiac negative stool .
Extremities :
without clubbing , cyanosis or edema or stigmata of subacute bacterial endocarditis .
Normal pulses were palpated .
Neurologic exam :

Extensive mental status testing was normal , except for recalling only one out of three objects at five minutes .
There was a touch an anosognosia .
Cranial nerve exam :
visual fields were full o.s. , visual acuity was 20/70 o.s.
Pupil o.s. reacted to light .
EOMs with full range of movement , no nystagmus .

No atrophy was noted .
Sensory exam showed some leftsided errors with pinprick and proprioception .
Cerebellar exam :
finger / to/nose was with mild dysmetria , exaggerated on tracking ; rapid alternating movements normal , heel-to-shin was good with few errors .
LABORATORY DATA :
Chest xray showed expanded lungs with biapical pulmonary opacities .
EKG :
left bundle branch block .
Urinalysis was unremarkable .
BUN 27 , with a creatinine of .9 , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal .
Her admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .
Albumin 2.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
# 1. cerebrovascular accident .
The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .
This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .
The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .
Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .
Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .
Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .
The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .
She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .
Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .
Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .
She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .
In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .
It is discontinued at the time of transport .
The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .
During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .
On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .
There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .
At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient &apos;s family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .
What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .
Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .
Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .
Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .
As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .
While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .
Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .
These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .
The results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .
I will be happy to furnish the results .
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 .
Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .
EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .
We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .
Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .
The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .
It has been evaluated in the past without success .
During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .
Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .
Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .
This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .
Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .
The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .
In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .
This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .
CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .
A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .
A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .
The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .
The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .
Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .
It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .
It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .
The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .
We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .
This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .
The patient has glaucoma .
Her medications are as listed below .
Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .
His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .

His last admission was 9-14-93 , for a transfusion without complications , and prior to admission the patient reports having several days of increasing weakness , dizziness and fatigue .
His wife says his hands and lips have been blue .
Apparently , he had had a low hematocrit as an outpatient and was checked two weeks prior to admission but was not given transfusion because the patient did not want to come in at that time .
Aside from the above , the patient had felt that baseline without fever and chills or change in chronic cough .
He had no increase in his congestive heart failure symptoms , no chest pain , and no hemoptysis or changed in arthritis .

LABORATORY DATA :
SMA-7 was unremarkable aside form a creatinine of 1.6 and a glucose of 207 ; otherwise , was within normal limits .
Hematocrit was 22.4 ; white count .59 ; platelets 84.
The patient had an absolute neutropenia with a ANC of 318 ; differential revealed 48 segs , 6 bands , 40 lymphs , 4 monos .
Digoxin level was 1.4 .
Theo-Dur level was 15 .
PT was 12.5 ; PTT 27.0 .
Urinalysis was within normal limits .
Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted .
EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .
There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .
There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .
In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .
The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist , Dr. Taange Peter , and Cardiologist , Dr. Peter .

1 ) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED .
2 ) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY .
3 ) END STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vinktlandfreierm was admitted from Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :
The family was notified and came in to see the patient .
The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough .
The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. Erm Neidwierst , was notified as well .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY AT 23 WEEKS .
HYPERCALCEMIA .
INFERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from Bri Health with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until July of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On 12/23 , she was seen by Dr. Stonge at Bri Health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at Bri Health under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1. METASTATIC PROSTATE CA .
2. OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY , STATUS POST LEFT NEPHROSTOMY .
3. HYPERTENSION .
4. ANEMIA .
5. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE .
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
This 88-year-old male with history of prostate CA was admitted from an outside hospital secondary to persistent hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .
No cough .
No chest pain .
No palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .

The patient has been living in the Kansas for more than 20 years .
He was originally from Wark and he speaks Portuguese only .
He is now living with his son and daughter , and five other children .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient was a frail looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress .
Temperature 95.4 , pulse 120 , blood pressure 150/80 , respiratory rate 24 , 95% on room air .
Conjunctiva were not pale .
Sclera nonicteric .

Isocoric cataract bilaterally .
Mouth :
Mucous membranes slightly dry .
No oral ulcers .
Neck :
Supple .
Jugular vein not engorged .
Carotid pulses bounding very strongly .
No thyromegaly .
Chest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base .
Heart initially tachycardia , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .
Abdomen :
Soft .
Liver and spleen were not palpable .
Bowel sounds normoactive .
Extremities :
Traced pitting edema .
No cyanosis and no clubbing .
Peripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .
No calf tenderness .
Homan &apos;s sign negative .
Neurologic :
Examination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .
Liver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .
CBC :
WBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .
PT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .
No lung infiltrate .
CT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .
A mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .
The CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .
CK enzymes 146 .
Repeated three times and remained flat .
Troponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .

Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .

ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
5-3-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
5-12-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 .
He was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70% FIO2 .
Tracheostomy tube was in good position .
There was an audible air leak .
His chest showed bilateral rhonchi .
The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper .
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms .
The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .
The steroids were tapered .
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .
These results were all negative .
He continued to require very high FIO2 .
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .

CALL , GRANRIVERN S
UNIT NUMBER :
585-28-96
ADMISSION DATE :
10/14/96
DISCHARGE DATE :
10/27/96 date of birth ; September 30 , 1917
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left anterior temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , right frontal infarct , hypertension , and question progressive supranuclear palsy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on 10/18/96 .
THER PROCEDURES :
arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head CT scan on 10/14/96
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Granrivern Call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .

There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .

He had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
His toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Dilantin 100 mgs po tid , Carafate 1 gram po qid , Digoxin 0.25 mgs po qd , Isordil 20 mgs po tid , Captopril 25 mgs po tid , Lopressor 50 mgs po bid , Colace 100 mgs po tid , and Coumadin 2 mgs po qhs .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : 
Atrial fibrillation . 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy . 
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 
Electrical cardioversion . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
Ms. Lenkpruskihkooglekih is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance . 
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% . 
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance . 
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 . 
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 
Includes a history of hypertension ; multinodular goiter ; subtotal thyroidectomy . 
MEDICATIONS : 
Include Cardizem CD 180 mg daily ; Monopril 10 mg daily ; Digoxin .25 mg daily ; and Lasix 40 mg every other day . 
ALLERGIES : 
To Quinidine , Procardia , and sulfa antibiotics . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : 
On examination , blood pressure was 200/100 ; heart rate 120 per minute ( atrial fibrillation ) . 
The patient was noted to be anxious . 
There was no neck vein distension or carotid bruits . 
Heart sounds were normal . 
The lungs were clear . 
The abdominal examination was benign . 
There was no peripheral edema . 
Pulses were all easily palpable . 
LABORATORY DATA : 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a QT interval of .46 seconds . 
There were diffuse ST segment and T-wave abnormalities , which were nonspecific . 
A complete blood count , electrolytes , BUN and creatinine were within normal limits . 
INR was elevated at 2.5 . 
An echocardiogram was performed , which showed completely normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction calculated at .74 . 
There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy , which had been an issue that had been raised on an echocardiogram in Ownra Cin , New Mexico on 12/06/96 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : 
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this . 
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules . 
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days . 
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 . 
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today . 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ther Ludzjesc at Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers in Connecticut . 
In addition , she will return to this hospital in early February for repeat attempt at electrical cardioversion on Amiodarone . 
She will continue her Coumadin until then and arrangements for her readmission can be made through Dr. Iceca Rhaltkaaispehbreun 's office here . 
MEDICATIONS : 
Other than the addition of Amiodarone 200 mg daily , will be the same as her admission medications .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cryptogenic cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Variceal bleeding .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Variceal banding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .
She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cryptogenic cirrhosis with an unclear work up .
Diverticular bleed requiring colostomy on May 96 .
Spinal stenosis .
Hysterectomy at the age of 32 .

She is able at baseline to walk one flight of stairs , 2 floor apartment .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Non contributory and unavailable as she is adopted .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is an obese , elderly woman in no acute distress .
vital signs :
158/60 with a heart rate of 85 , temperature 99.7 , respirations 14 .
Her neck showed no JVD .
Lungs clear to auscultation .
Her abdomen was obese and distended with good bowel sounds , large ventral hernia .
Colostomy with black stool .
She had some mid epigastric tenderness and no rebound .
Her heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with an S1-S2 , no murmur .
Her neurological exam was alert and oriented .
She had 5 out of 5 strength bilaterally and her toes were downgoing .
She had no evidence of asterixis .
Her skin looked very bronze and tan , especially in the sun exposed areas .
She had no spider angiomata , no palmar erythema , no xanthomas and no caput medusae .
She did not look teric ( ??? ) .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on December 4 , 1995 by Dr. Reg Cranka and Dr. Win Shufffyfe .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on December 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on December 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on December 6 , 1995 .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on December 25 , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. Asha Vengloan of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. Ca Shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
6. Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His other antibiotics were discontinued .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia .
7. Pain .
The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted .
He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone .
A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows :
Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid .

In summary this is a 25 year old male with a very complicated history and a patient of Dr. Breunkays &apos;s .
The patient was seen at Ph University Of Medical Center for problem regarding his constrictive pericarditis and underwent a surgical procedure to correct this .
Followup cardiac studies showed there was a resolution of his constrictive pericarditis .
The patient also had a gastric ulcer repaired at the same time .
Other issues of the patient are chronic and most likely will be followed up in hospitals closer to the patient &apos;s home .
If there are any questions regarding his care they should be directed to Dr. Cranka &apos;s office at Ph University Of Medical Center and we will be happy to contact any or all of the consultations concerned with Hauth &apos;s care .
Hauth is a very complicated patient and it was our pleasure to provide care for him at Ph University Of Medical Center .

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION : Home .
PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN :
Dr. Vito Dotzler , phone ( 259 ) 579-8396 , fax 898-3942 .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
1. Feeds - Breastfeeding ad lib , supplementing with Enfamil 24 or breastmilk 24 cal / oz made with 1 tsp of Enfamil powder per 100 cc of breastmilk .
2. Medications - Poly-Vi-James 1 cc p.o. q. day ; Iron or Fer-In-James 0.2 cc p.o. q. day to give 2 mg / kg / day
3. Car seat screening - Passed .
4. State newborn screening - Last on 2009-01-07 , all within normal range .
5. Immunizations received - Hepatitis B vaccine given 2009-01-22 .
6. Immunizations recommended -
Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from October through April for infants who meet
any of the following three criteria -
1. Born at less than 32 weeks ;
2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during respiratory syncytial virus season , with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings ; or
3. With chronic lung disease .
After some debate , we concluded that Vetrano was not at unusually high risk from RSV , but that her sister might be .
Vetrano probably does not need Synagis at least until her sibling is discharged from the hospital .
It may then be reasonable to treat both for the balance of the RSV season .
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they
reach six months of age , before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against
influenza to protect the infant .
7. Follow up - Follow up appointment with primary pediatrician within five days of discharge .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Prematurity , former 32 4/7 weeks , Twin #1
2. Rule out sepsis

She went to her primary care physician 's office on the day of admission complaining of abdominal pain , which she stated was constant but intermittently sharper at times .
The location was variable .
She also complained of some loose stools on the day of admission , no nausea or vomiting .
Her temperature was 100.4 in the office , and she had no chills .
She was sent for a CT scan of her abdomen , which revealed fluid and question of gas in the endometrial cavity , and she was sent to Pinewood , Norfolk for treatment and admission .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
Cesarean section x 2 , spontaneous abortion x 1 .
PAST GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY :
Last menstrual period 2009-02-21 .
Some spotting on the day prior to admission , but not a normal period .
Periods regular .
Lupron x three months prior to embolization .
Fibroid uterus status post embolization on 2009-01-07 .
Dilatation and curettage x 1 for SAB .
History of herpes simplex virus , last outbreak in 2000 .
No history of abnormal Pap smears .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

MEDICATIONS :
Flagyl .
ALLERGIES :
None .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
No smoking , alcohol or drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 100.4 , pulse 108 , respirations 20 , blood pressure 110/70 , oxygen saturation 100% on room air .
In general , she was in no acute distress .
Her abdomen was notable for voluntary guarding but no involuntary guarding or rebound , mild right lower quadrant tenderness greater than left lower quadrant , nondistended .
Her pelvic examination was notable for some brownish discharge .
Her uterus and adnexa were difficult to assess secondary to voluntary tensing of her abdomen .
ASSESSMENT :
This is a 49-year-old gravida III , para II , status post uterine artery embolization on 2009-01-07 due to uterine fibroids , with continued abdominal pain and CT scan revealing fluid and gas in the endometrial cavity .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and was initially started on intravenous ampicillin , gentamicin and clindamycin .
Her initial white blood cell count was 11.3 , with a normal differential .
Her sedimentation rate was elevated at 110 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics .
On hospital day number three , her blood cultures came back positive in the anaerobic culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters .
Further identification revealed staphylococcus coag-negative , which was sensitive to gentamicin and clindamycin .
She was continued on her antibiotics , and was afebrile until hospital day number five , when she had a temperature spike to 102.3 .
Repeat blood cultures were sent .
Her white blood cell count was 12.8 , with a normal differential .
At this time , an Infectious Disease consult was obtained , and the recommendation was to discontinue the ampicillin , gentamicin and clindamycin , and start her on intravenous Unasyn .
She underwent a pelvic ultrasound and an abdomen and pelvis CT , which revealed continued air in the endometrial cavity vs. in the fundal fibroid .
Discussion was had at this time with the patient regarding whether or not this represented an infected abscess vs. post-surgical change .
Extensive discussion was held , and second opinion was obtained regarding the need for
possible drainage of the abscess vs. hysterectomy .
The patient requested an outside second opinion , as she was reluctant to undergo hysterectomy at this time .
She was discharged to home on hospital day number eight , on oral antibiotics .
The patient was to have a repeat CT scan in one week .
She was also to obtain a second opinion regarding the question of possible surgical management .

The patient is an 83 - year-old male with a history of diabetes , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol without presented to the hospital for lower extremity angiograph ; however , that was deferred due to new onset renal failure .
1. RENAL FAILURE :
The patient was initially thought to be prerenal , and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake .
He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis .
His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay , and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease .
During his hospital stay , he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
He also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection .
The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine .
After being treated with lidocaine , the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit .
His nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip .
It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02 .
A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior .
He had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted , and due to the patient 's acute illness , they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated .
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia .
He was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone .
He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors .
Of note , he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay .
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output .
The patient 's family eventually decided to withdraw care , and the patient was extubated and passed away on 2009-07-12 .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection .
He then developed positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin , and that was continued .
When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors , his antibiotics were broadened , and he was put on stress-dose steroids .
He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .
3. PULMONARY :
The patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia .
He was actually extubated on 07-09 , but then reintubated one hour later due to hypoxia .
He was also found to have a bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
On 07-12 , after and extensive family meeting , the family decided to extubate the patient and make him comfortable , and he passed away at 5:20 on 2009-07-12 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Cordano is a 58-year-old gentlemen with a past medical history significant for primary sclerosing cholangitis who presented with a chief complaint of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
The most recent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was done in 2009-07-25 .
At the time an 8 Caucasian catheter was placed in the common hepatic/bioduct for external drainage .
The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also showed the presence proximal common bile duct .
Nodularities in the common bile duct visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was also worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma and the patient was admitted to the Blue General Surgery Service for possible surgical interventions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Ulcerative colitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Status post placement of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage with placement of 8 Caucasian nephrostomy catheter in the common bile duct .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Ursodiol 600 mg t.i.d.
2. Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
The patient is a jaundiced looking gentlemen in no acute distress .
The head is normocephalic , atraumatic and eyes are icteric .
The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy .
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart has a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 , S2 .
There is no murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses and nondistended .
There is no hepatosplenomegaly .
Rectal exam showed no masses and is guaiac negative .
The extremities have distal pulses and were warm and well perfused .
Neurological exam was grossly intact .
LABORATORY STUDIES AT ADMISSION :
A white blood cell count of 14.2 , hematocrit of 35.3 , platelet count of 449,000 .
Sodium of 130 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.1, prothrombin time 14.1 , partial thrombin time 29.7 .
INR 1.4 .
ALT 106 , AST 149 , alkaline phosphatase 242 .
Total bilirubin 10.1 , amylase 90 and lipase 112 .
RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES AT TIME OF ADMISSION :
Chest x-ray revealed minimal left base atelectasis and elevation of left hemidiaphragm .
A CT scan with po contrast showed dilation of intrahepatic common bile duct which is improved from previous studies .
It is also noted that there was splenomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Cordano was admitted on 2009-08-17 for a replacement of transhepatic biliary drainage catheter .
At that time , cholangiogram confirmed that there was a distal stricture of the common bile duct .
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings
and it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma .
Therefore , the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2009-08-24 for a Whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy .
On exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis .
Intraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the
region nodularity , which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology .
They were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy
was performed .
Cholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30.0 on postoperative day number two .
He was given Unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment .
At the time , blood , urine and bile was sent for culture , which were all negative .
A chest x-ray was also negative for any pneumonia .
Postoperatively , Mr. Cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour .
Fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1% suggesting a prerenal etiology .
The sodium creatinine peaked at 2.0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered .
He responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output .
At the same time , the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid .
He also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema .
On postoperative day number eight , the patient 's oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for fluid management .
Chest x-ray and sputum culture obtained at the time were negative and the patient was treated with 100% nonrebreather which improved his oxygenation .
While he is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit , paracentesis was performed and it
revealed greater than 24,000 white blood cell count in the ascites which is consistent with SVT .
He was given Zosyn for empiric treatment .
Gram stain and culture of the ascites failed to identify any organism .
He was weaned from oxygen requirement and was continued on normal saline boluses and
intravenous albumin for treatment of prerenal azotemia .
Somatostatin and midodrine were also given for this condition and he also received packed red blood cells .
On postoperative day number ten , the patient returned to the floor with improved renal function and without oxygen requirement .
The somatostatin and the midodrine were discontinued and the regimen of Lasix and spironolactone was started for diuresis .
His creatinine levels trended toward normal and the fractional excretion of sodium also increased indicating a resolution of the prerenal kidney failure .
On postoperative day number 17 , the patient was discharged .
At the time he took good po .
He has a PICC line in place for continued treatment with Rocephin and he will have a visiting nurse to help him to administer these medications .
While in the hospital , the patient received initial work-up including echocardiogram , electrocardiogram and serology studies to be listed for liver transplant .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Rocephin 1 gram q.d.
2. Furosemide 10 mg q.d.
3. Spironolactone 100 mg q.d.
4. Ursodiol 600 mg po t.i.d.

NEUROMEDIC
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45-year-old woman with multiple familial cavernous hemangiomas .
She is right-handed .
She was in her usual state of health until one and a half weeks prior to admission .
She developed an ear ache , for which she saw her primary care physician , Evelyn was prescribed cortisone drops .
A few days later she complained of dizziness .
This was mostly described as feeling unsteady on her feet .
She stated that she had trouble knowing if her feet were touching the ground .
She was seen again by primary care physician , Roderick since she had complaints of dizziness , as well as a new complaint of decreased hearing and the sensation of static in her ears , meniere 's disease was considered .
She was given an oral prednisone taper .
This unsteady gait progressed , and then she subsequently started to develop a pins and needle feeling in the face , hands and feet bilaterally .
Her hearing got progressively worse and the sound of static increased .
She was very fatigued .
At an outside hospital , head CT revealed a 1.5 cm diameter hyperdense mass in the pons , slightly off center to the right .
She was transferred here for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for multiple cavernous hemangiomas .
She has had at least two bleeding episodes in the past , mostly described as being accompanied by generalized weakness .
She has had at least two generalized seizures in the past , but she has not had one since she was 26 years old .
She was never on an anticonvulsant due to her former beliefs as N. Derk Scientist .
She no longer observes that belief system .
MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone taper as above .
ALLERGIES :
None .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Strong maternal history of hemangiomas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 99.2 .
Pulse 60 .
Blood pressure 120/80 .
Respiratory rate 14 .
In general , she was a thin well-appearing woman in no acute distress .
Sclera were anicteric .
Neck was supple .
Chest was clear .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , nontender and distended .
Extremities showed no edema .
Neurologically , she was awoken from sleep by voice , cooperative , but mildly drowsy .
She became more alert during the remainder of the exam .
Speech was fluent but slow , and there was long response latencies before she would initiate speech .
She otherwise had normal spontaneous movements and facial expression and did not appear to be abulic .
She had normal comprehension .
She was able to give a detailed history in an organized manner .
There was no dysarthria .
Language was normal .
There was no evidence of any special neglect .
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
Visual fields were full .
Extraocular movements were full with normal smooth pursuit to the left .
Pursuit was interrupted by >.....< when tracking from left to right .
She had sustained gaze holding nystagmus in both horizontal directions .
There was no rotary component .
She had a mildly widened right palpable fissure .
There was decreased excursion of the right mouth and flattening of the right nasolabial fold ( mild ) .
Light touch was subjectively abnormal on both sides of the face .
Hearing was diminished for conversational speech .
Palate and tongue moved normally in the midline .
There was a mild left pronator drift .
Finger tapping and rapid alternating movements were slow on the left and she had trouble isolating individual finger movements .
There was mild finger-to-nose dysmetria on the left .
Power was mildly diminished in the finger extensors and hand intrinsics on the left , otherwise , power was full throughout .
Reflexes were brisk in the legs with 4-5 beats of clonus at the ankles bilaterally .
She had bilateral upgoing toes .
She made mistakes with position sense , roughly at chance level with both great toes and the left first finger , position sense in the right limb seems preserved .
Gait was wide based , very unsteady , veering to the left and to the right .
She retropulsed and would have pitched backwards without the assistance of the examiner .
LABORATORIES :
White blood cell count 7.8 with 86% polymorphonuclear cells , 11.1 lymphocytes , hemoglobin 14.3 , hematocrit 40.5 , MCV 88 , INR 1.0 , PTT 24.7 , PT 12.3 , platelet count 295,000 , glucose 81 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 , CO2 26 , calcium 9.3 , phosphate 4.8 , magnesium 2.3 .
MRI of the brain revealed multiple foci susceptibility artifact within the brain .
These were seen best in gradient echocardiogram images .
There was a large focus of subacute blood products in the mid to low pons suggesting recent hemorrhage into a cavernous angioma .
There was some mild surrounding edema .
There are also tiny foci artifact within the cerebellum and base of the pons .
There was a larger area of susceptibility artifact in the left temporal lobe , right frontal lobe , and the splenius of the corpus collasum .
The brain parenchyma was otherwise normal .
There was mild enhancement of the pontine hemorrhagic mass but none elsewhere .
There was no areas of restricted diffusion to indicate infarction .
MRA of the brain was unremarkable .
There was no communication >.......< in the visualized vessels and the angiomas .
Follow-up CT was obtained the second day of admission .
There was no evidence of developing hydrocephalus , which was a concern due to the surrounding edema , and possible suppression of the fourth ventricle .
There was no significant change in size of the subacute pontine hemorrhage .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45 - year-old woman with a strong family history of cavernous angiomas .
She has had several prior bleeding events and presented with a subacute bleed in the mid to lower pons .
There was relatively central in location , with only a slight right-sided predominance .
Her physical examination remained relatively unchanged , with resolution of the subtle left hand weakness and right facial weakness .
Her gait remained severely ataxic , likely secondary to sensory deafferentation , as well as involvement of crossing pontine cerebellar fibers .
Therefore , it was recommended that she have aggressive Physical Therapy at an Acute Rehabilitation Center .
The case was discussed with Dr. Harold from the Falmouth Hospital .
He has followed this family in the past and will see her in follow-up .
We will arrange to have a copy of the MRI scans sent to him .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Familial cavernous hemangiomas , status post a subacute pontine hemorrhage .
2. Severe gait ataxia .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Gabapentin 100 mg po t.i.d. for paresthesias .
2. Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
3. Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d.

The U/A was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization .
Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , right dominant coronary artery system with occlusive single vessel disease of the LAD .
Multiple wires were used to attempt to cross the total occlusion , but were ultimately unsuccessful .
The patient was continued on a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation .
Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2010-03-12 for coronary artery bypass grafting times two ; LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
Subsequent to this , the patient was transferred to the CRSU for closer monitoring .
He was deemed to be too lethargic and sleepy to be extubated on postoperative day number zero .
The patient was extubated early on postoperative day number one without significant complication .
He remained in atrial fibrillation .
The EP Service was consulted regarding the patient 's atrial fibrillation .
This was his main issue in the postoperative course .
He was attempted on multiple different drugs including Procainamide , Diltiazem , Esmolol , Sotalol , Amiodarone .
The patient was kept therapeutically anticoagulated throughout this period .
The patient was also started on digoxin .
Ultimately , the patient was transferred to the floor and anticoagulation with Coumadin was begun .
The patient arrived on the floor with medications as follows :
Sotalol 180 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
While the patient was awaiting therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin , he spontaneously converted into normal sinus rhythm .
The patient was found to have a resting heart rate of approximately 50 subsequent to this .
In consultation with the EP Service , Diltiazem was stopped .
After approximately 24 hours , the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation and Diltiazem was restarted at 60 mg q.i.d.
The patient then had one more episode where he was converted to normal sinus rhythm but this lasted only a few hours before reverting back to atrial fibrillation .
The patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day number 16 , tolerating a regular diet , and adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , having no anginal symptoms and with an INR of 2.0 .
The patient failed multiple attempts at cardioversion .

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION :
Included normal CBC , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 up from baseline of about 1.5 .
Troponin 4.7 , CK 101 , MB 3 .
RADIOLOGY :
Chest x-ray showed patient was in congestive heart failure .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
Showed normal sinus rhythm at 107 beats per minute with left axis deviation and poor R-wave progression .
However , no acute changes were apparent .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service and treated for presumed diastolic and systolic dysfunction .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function as well as hypokinesis of the lower half of septum and apex .
Also of note was the distal lateral wall hypokinesis .
The wall motion abnormalities were noted to be new .
It was believed that a troponin on admission in addition to the wall motion abnormalities she underwent a non-Q wave myocardial infarction prior to resulted in her current cardiac failure .
Throughout hospital course patient 's troponin trended down to less than 0.3 .
Heart Failure Service was involved .
She was continued with aggressive diuresis .
She was started on _________ with excellent diuresis , however , her renal functioning worsening .
A cardiac catheterization was deferred until the renal issue could be resolved .
However , her creatinine continued to increase .
Diuresis was halted and without improvement in creatinine .
Renal was consulted .
A renal ultrasound was obtained .
It showed a right kidney size of 6.3 cm and a left kidney size of 8.4 cm .
Given her hypertension which was very difficult to control , it was felt that she had renal artery stenosis and thus she underwent MRA of the kidney which showed severe right renal artery stenosis at its origin .
There was also moderate to severe focal stenosis of the left renal artery approximately 1.3 cm from its origin .
Dr. ______________ consulted on the case .
She was transferred to the unit overnight to assess volume which was noted to be optimal .
On 05-25 she underwent catheterization and subsequent stenting of the left renal artery .
Due to dye load required to assess the coronary disease were not visualized .
After the procedure the patient did well .
However , her creatinine has worsened up to 4.2 .
However , her urine output has improved .
She has not required hemodialysis at this time .
She will need close follow up of her renal functioning .
The patient is discharged to an extended discharge facility .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
2. Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure .
3. Bilateral renal artery stenosis status post stent left renal artery .
4. Acute renal failure .
5. Hypertension .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 55 - year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was referred to Dr. Brenda Hummer for discussion for surgical options to free this condition .
The patient reportedly had been experiencing increasing fatigue and dyspnea with exertion for the year prior to his admission .
The patient reported increasingly frequent episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath accompanied with coughing spells after walking approximately a half a mile or climbing three flights of stairs .
On 2010-05-27 , an echocardiogram was done which revealed critical fibrocalcific aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 125 mmHg , a mean gradient of 74 mmHg , an Oak Bluffs of 0.44 , and 1+ aortic and mitral insufficiency .
The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2010-06-01 , which demonstrated no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease , but critical aortic stenosis consistent with his echocardiogram study results .
The patient was subsequently scheduled for a mechanical aortic valve replacement procedure with aortic replacement on 2010-06-07 .

The patient denied any tobacco or alcohol history .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 2010-06-07 , the patient underwent a mechanical aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Carbomedics mechanical valve and a Supra coronary aortic graft with gelweave 28 mm .
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 155 minutes and a crossclamp time of
130 minutes , and a rest time of 16 minutes .
The patient 's pericardium was left open ; lines placed included a right radial line and a right IJ line ; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed ; two mediastinal tubes were placed .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit , intubated , for further evaluation and management .
On transfer , the patient 's mean arterial pressure was 76 , CVP 12 , PAD 17 , and his Bennie was 25 .
The patient was AV paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute .
Active drips included milrinone , Levophed , propofol , and insulin .
On postoperative day number one , the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication .
The patient was then advanced to oral intake which he tolerated without complication .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Robert Mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of peripheral neuropathy , kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy , as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation .
Mr.  Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6 , less so at C4-C5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side C5-C6 .
Therefore , he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees ; blood pressure 145/80 ; pulse 60 ; respiratory rate 10 ; 100% on a non-rebreather .
He was awake , alert , uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site .
The wounds were clean , dry and intact , and flat .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
While in the PACU , Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89% .
His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask .
Interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively .
He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement .
The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume .
No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction .
He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully .
He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume .
He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day .
Also in the Intensive Care Unit , O2 saturation was closely monitored .
The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine , although continued to saturate well .
He was transferred to Medicine the morning of 2010-08-30 , for continued medical management post surgery .
On the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants .
1. When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .
2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .
In addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .
3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :
Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .
Finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .
4. Infectious causes were evaluated .
He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .
A lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .
5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .
A head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .
No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .
This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .
6. Trauma was also considered .
The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .
Throughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .
There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .
Liver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .
TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .
RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .
The assay was nonreactive .
An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .
On the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .
Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point
restraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .
The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .
Later in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .
They were taken off two at a time .
The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .
Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .
haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .
Each progressive day,  Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .
The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .
Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .
With this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .
While the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .
As for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .
The only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :
Soreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .
In addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .
This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged on 09-02 .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Follow-up with Dr. Williams on Tuesday , 09-07 , at noon .
2. Follow-up with Dr. Michael , his psychiatrist , on Wednesday , 09-08 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Delta MS Rachel Rohrer .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 33 - year-old Asian-Caucasian male with a history of Type 1 diabetes , asthma , alcohol abuse , and personality disorder / depression admitted on 2010-08-28 for persistent hypoglycemia .
The patient complained of diaphoresis , confusion , dizziness , lightheadedness after drinking a 24 ounce beer and taking at least an extra 15 units of NPH insulin the evening of 2010-08-27 ( later reported over 70 U insulin administered from 2.30 PM until time of presentation ) followed by not eating dinner .
His symptoms mildly improved after eating a candy bar .
The EMS was called and found his blood sugar at the time to be 61 and noted to be 41 in the Emergency Department .
He denied any seizure activity , loss of consciousness , incontinence , shortness of breath , fevers , or chills , chest pain , change in urinary or bowel habits , or suicidal ideation .
He has been depressed recently regarding stress with his home life and on the night of his extra insulin doses , his wife had just kicked him out of the house .
He has had four past hospitalizations for attempted suicide with insulin overdosing , usually denied .
The wife also states that he drinks more than he states .
In the Emergency Department , he received 3.5 amps of D50 and then D5 normal saline and D10 normal saline with blood sugars that were slow to increase leading the ICU team to suspect that the patient had taken more insulin than he admitted .
He also had a very positive tox screen for alcohol .
His fingersticks are currently in the 200 s and his normal blood glucose at home ranges between 90-200 per the patient .
The patient also now complains of increased right upper quadrant / right rib cage pain and new headache .
He also complains of chronic photophobia which is unchanged .
He denied visual changes , lightheadedness of dizziness currently , neck stiffness , or pain in any other area .

General :
The patient was a soft-spoken male resting in his bed in no acute distress .
HEENT :
The pupils were equally round and reactive to light .
Extraocular muscles were intact .
Sclerae were anicteric .
Moist mucous membranes , clear oropharynx .
Neck :
Supple , no masses , no lymphadenopathy .
Cardiovascular :
Regular rate , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
Normal S1 , S2 .
Pulmonary :
Clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Normoactive bowel sounds , soft , mildly tender at right upper quadrant just inferior to the lower ribs , no epigastric tenderness .
Extremities : Warm and well perfuse .
Normal peripheral pulses .
Neurologic :

LABORATORY / RADIOLOGIC DATA :
CBC with a white count of 6.2 , hemoglobin 13.3 , hematocrit 39.4 , platelet 307,000 .
Sodium 142 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 30 , BUN 7 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 41 .
Calcium 9.6 , magnesium 2.2 , phosphorus 7.4 , vitamin B12 level 320 , folate 9.5 , TSH 1.4 , acetone negative .
Serum tox screen , alcohol 32 mg per deciliter , negative for aspirin , benzos , barbiturates , and TCA .
Urine tox screen negative for benzos , barbiturates , opiates , cocaine , amphetamines , and methadone .
Telemetry was notable for episodes of sinus tachycardia to 120s to 140s only .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. HYPOGLYCEMIA :
The patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin ; however , with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU , this resolved and the patient also began to eat .
We checked fingerstick glucoses q.i.d. and at 3:00 a.m.
His glucose on the morning of discharge was about 60 so we opted to decrease his p.m. NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin .
He should also continue having a snack at midnight if able .
It is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet .
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE :
It is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits .
He did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in 2009-09-03 .
He had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s; however , he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines .
This alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center .
We had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this .
3. DEPRESSION vs. Borderline personality disorder :
The patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life , it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth .
He received a one-to-one sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient 's safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment .
He will need close follow-up regarding his depression as an outpatient , although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through .
4. HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE :
His blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of 130s systolic during his admission , thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past .
5. RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN :
We obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs , amylase , and lipase which were all normal .
He had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys .
it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause .
6. PROPHYLAXIS :
He was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .
7. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION :
He complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized .
The patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of Neutra-Phos during his ICU stay .
He was given two doses of calcium carbonate 1 gram , and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion .
He has been asymptomatic .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Depression .
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .
3. Asthma .
4. Alcohol abuse .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. , 5 units q.p.m.
2. Humalog sliding scale insulin for fingerstick blood glucose 151-200 2 units ; 201-250 4 units ; 251-300 6 units ; 301-350 8 units ; 351-400 10 units ; greater than 400 12 units .
3. Multivitamin .
4. Fluticasone .
5. Albuterol p.r.n.
6. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS :
The patient will be transferred to the Inpatient Psychiatry Unit on Springfield Municipal Hospital IV for further evaluation and treatment of his depression and possible suicidal ideation .
He will follow-up with his primary care doctor , Dr. Gillis , after discharge , Johannes for Diabetes management , and Psychiatry for further management of his impulsive behaviors .

ADDENDUM :
The patient was extubated overnight without incident .
He had a good cardiac index off all inotropic medications and his Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued .
The patient underwent an exchange peritoneal dialysis .
The Parrack Diabetes Center was consulted to help manage the patient 's hyperglycemia .
By postoperative day two , the patient had remained in sinus rhythm and his Lopressor was increased .
He was having a bit of a respiratory acidosis , therefore , bicarbonate was added to the dialysate .
His mediastinal chest tubes were removed , however , his pleural chest tubes remained in place .
On postoperative day three , it was apparent that , despite an oxygen saturation of 99% on three liters , that the patient was still in a respiratory acidosis , and he received aggressive pulmonary toilette .
His pleural chest tubes were removed .
On postoperative day four , the patient Cordis was removed .
His Lopressor was increased another increment .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the floor on postoperative day five in stable and good condition .
Once on the floor , the patient had an uneventful hospital course , remaining afebrile for the remainder of his hospital stay .
The patient 's only issue was his hypertension .
On postoperative day seven , the patient had a peak blood pressure of 210/100 .
The decision was made to start the patient on lisinopril , and the initial dose of 7.5 mg was increased to 10 mg daily by the day of discharge in order to control his pressure more tightly .

INDICATION FOR ADMISSION :
Transfer from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital for an endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Eugene is a 67 year old male with a remote history of chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse 30 years ago , who is transferred now from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital for an ERCP and work-up for a cystic lesion at the head of his pancreas on CT scan shown at the outside hospital .
The patient presented initially to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital at the end of December for abdominal pain , and was found to have pancreatitis .
During this admission , two CT scans had shown a question of an enlargement of the head of his pancreas
versus early pseudocyst .
The patient was discharged home early from this admission due to family needs .
While at home , the patient did not do well and could tolerate minimal food intake and lost about 20 pounds in one month .
On an office visit on 01-14 , the patient was found to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase .
That evening , the patient again developed abdominal pain "" like his pancreatitis "" with nausea and vomiting , for which he was admitted to the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital .
In the Emergency Department at the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient was noted to have vomited some heme positive material .
His complete blood count showed 11% bandemia with a total white count of 10 .
A HIDA scan showed no flow , question of pancreatitis versus common bile duct obstruction .
His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm .
A chest x-ray was unremarkable .
During his admission to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient had dropped his hematocrit to the 30 s with recorded melena .
He received an MRCP which was negative for evidence of stones .
An ultrasound showed normal gallbladder with no wall thickening but a dilated common bile duct of 8 mm measured on CT scan .
The patient had an attempted ERCP on 01-18 , which was unsuccessful due to a long nipple like papilla .
He was therefore transferred to Saints Medical Center for endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography .
The patient 's blood cultures at outside hospital grew out Streptococcus sanguis-gordonii on 01-18 .
This was sensitive to Clindamycin , Erythromycin , penicillin S and Vancomycin .
Prior to this result , the patient had already been on Ampicillin , Sulbactam and Gentamycin .
It appears from the Discharge summary that the patient was placed on Unasyn 3 grams intravenously every six hours after his ERCP .

There was no formal strength test done .
LABORATORY :
Studies revealed a hematocrit of 32.6 , white count of 6.0 .
His platelet count was 267 .
His MCV was 88 , red cell distribution was 13.4 .
Chemistry on admission showed a sodium of 141 , potassium of 4.3 , chloride of 107 , bicarbonate of 25 , BUN of 4 , creatinine of 0.6 and a sugar of 177 .
Liver function tests revealed an ALT of 31 , AST of 36 , alkaline phosphatase of 509 .
Total bilirubin was 0.8 .
Albumin was 2.6 .
His blood cultures were drawn and pending .
Urinalysis revealed trace glucose , no ketones , no red cells , no white cells and less than one epithelial cells .
COURSE IN HOSPITAL :
The patient was taken down to the endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatogram upon admission .
On this examination , the patient was found to have mild biliary stricture most likely secondary to chronic pancreatitis .
Cytology was obtained .
He was also found to have dilated pancreatic ducts with calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis .
The patient underwent a percutaneous sphincterotomy extended to a full sphincterectomy .
He also had successful extraction of stone fragments .
The patient tolerated this procedure well and had no complications .
The patient subsequently underwent a CT scan angiogram with Pancreas protocol to assess the pseudocyst versus enlarged pancreas head .
The results of this study indicated that this structure at the head of his pancreas is most likely a forming pseudocyst ; however , the suspicion of malignancy is still possible and the patient underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of this mass on 2011-01-20 .
The cytology for this biopsy is still pending .
The patient recovered well status post these two procedures .
He had no complications and no subsequently pancreatitis .
His alkaline phosphatase and all the other abnormal liver function tests were resolving .
He had no pain and did not require any pain medications .
He was tolerating food very well and was afebrile throughout admission .
With regards to the patient 's documented Strep septicemia in the outside hospital , the Infectious Disease Team was formally consulted .
Upon obtaining more information from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , it appears that the patient had two out of four bottles growing out Streptococcus sanguis in the outside hospital .
The patient appeared to have been covered by Ampicillin , Gentamycin and then Unasyn in the outside hospital .
The patient , on admission , was placed on Ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl .
With repeated blood cultures that were negative , the patient was reduced to single Mckenzie of intravenous Ampicillin .
For this documented septicemia , this patient went for a endocarditis work-up .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed no vegetations .
On this echocardiogram , he was found to have mildly dilated left atrium , mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , and a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55% .
There were no other abnormalities noted on this study .
The patient then underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram on 01-24 .
On this echocardiogram , he was again noted to not have any evidence for valvular vegetations .
A complex plaque was found in the aortic arch in the descending thoracic aorta , although this plaque is non-mobile .
There was focal mitral valve prolapse noted without pathologic mitral regurgitation .
The patient was noted to have trace aortic regurgitation .
A Panorex x-ray of his two teeth were obtained and a Dental Consultation was done .
The patient was thought to have normal dental hygiene and low suspicion for a source of his alpha septicemia from his mouth .
Infectious Disease Department as well as Cardiology had recommended a formal 14 - day course of intravenous antibiotics to treat a documented alpha Streptococcal septicemia from outside hospital blood cultures .
The patient 's insurance company , however , would not pay for home antibiotics .
After much discussion with the patient , the patient was informed of the risks of not finishing a 14 day course of intravenous antibiotics and chose to go home .
He had three days of antibiotics remaining at the time of discharge .
It was discussed with the patient to send him out on Augmentin 500 mg three times a day for ten more days .
He was to follow-up with his primary care physician within two to three days for repeat laboratory studies and blood cultures .
He was to return to the hospital with any signs of shaking chills or fever .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Pancreatitis status post endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy .
2. Alpha Streptococcus septicemia .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Shortness of breath .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71-year-old-female with asthma and a history of recent exacerbation of lower extremity edema who , at her baseline , gets short of breath walking across the room and sleeps on four pillows times several years .
She has reported that she has had upper respiratory symptoms times several days with increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , eventually at rest with marked wheezing .
She also has a cough with a small amount of white sputum .
At 3 a.m. on the day of admission , she became much worse and after several days of increasing her meter-dosed inhaler use , she call Emergency Medical Services which assessed her as having heart failure with elevated jugular venous distention and rales .
She received aspirin , Lasix 40 mg intravenously times two , 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin times four , plus morphine sulfate .
Her blood pressure was noted to be up to 220/110 .
She was taken to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Emergency Room where she was assessed as having asthma .
She then received continuous nebulizer treatments for approximately eight hours with minimal improvement .
She did receive intravenous nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room for blood pressure controlled to the 170s .
She initially received a treatment of BiPAP on arrival as she was barely able to speak .
She also received 80 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department .
She was never hypoxic but initially her arterial blood gas showed a respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 71 .
The patient does have a vague history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but this is felt to be inaccurate .
She also received captopril 12.5 mg times one .
Recently , the patient has been treated with several steroid tapers .
Depending on the family , patient , and the OMR records , the exact duration of the most recent one was unclear .
It either ended in 2011-04-11 or continued through 2011-05-11 with use of Augmentin ; and , by report , lasted until 06-07 .
However , the family said the patient has been on steroids for several weeks .

Pulmonary function tests most recently in 2009-01-10 were not obstructive .
They showed an FVC of 91% of predicted , and a FEV1 of 104% of predicted , with a ratio of 114% .
In 2003 , there was 19% change of the FEV1 and an 11% change in the FVC with bronchodilators .
2. Mild hypertension , especially on prednisone .
3. Hypoplastic left lower extremity and hip repair at the age of five .
4. Polio .
5. Status post cesarean section .

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
On transfer , she also arrived on 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and reports p.r.n. Alka-Seltzer , sinus and NyQuil use .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems were notable for lower extremity edema which worsened in May .
She says she has had this intermittently with hot summers in the past .
She denies chest pain .
She does have chest tightness since two days ago , coinciding with her wheezing .
She had paroxysms of cough and shortness of breath which resolves with water and sitting up .
This is worse when she has asthma flares .
She denies a rash and any genitourinary symptoms .
She has had a constant runny nose and has had no sick contacts .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Physical examination revealed afebrile , respiratory rate of 23 , heart rate of 113 , blood pressure 130s/90s .
In general , this was a female in moderate distress secondary to shortness of breath , spoke in short phrases and then in complete sentences as the night went on .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat revealed oropharynx was moist .
There was no jugular venous distention .
There was no HDR .
Sclerae were anicteric .
Cardiovascular revealed she was tachycardic with a regular first heart sound and second heart sound .
Pulmonary revealed she had diffuse wheezes .
There were no rales .
She had reduced but adequate air movement .
The abdomen revealed normal active bowel sounds , soft , nontender , obese , and nondistended .
Extremities revealed left lower extremity was hypoplastic .
There was pitting edema on both sides of the lower extremities .
The right ankle was somewhat tender from this edema .
Neurologically , the patient was oriented to person , place , and time ; however , she was somewhat drowsy and at times was difficult to keep awake during conversations .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
White blood cell count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 37.5 , platelets of 236 .
INR of 1.3 , PTT of 30.3 .
Urinalysis revealed 6 to 10 red blood cells , 0 to 2 white blood cells , 4 epithelial cells with Foley in place .
Urine culture later grew out contaminated specimen .
Differential with 72 polys , 16 lymphocytes , 4.6 monocytes , 6.3 eosinophils .
Chem-7 was notable for a bicarbonate of 31 and a glucose of 156 .
Arterial blood gas was 7.24/71/227 .
Creatine kinase was 243 , with a MB of 9 , and a troponin of less than 0.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING :
Chest x-ray showed low lung volumes but no evidence of congestive heart failure .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 115 with a normal axis , intermittent Q wave in III; a wavy baseline .
The patient had a stress echocardiogram with a normal ejection fraction in 2007 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. PULMONARY :
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge .
She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent .
She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d.
She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed .
Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range .
Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department , she never became more hypercarbic , and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued .
On the night of admission and thereafter , she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep .
This would disappear whenever she was awake .
Her case was discussed with Ear/Nose/Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending .
She was given a trial of 80/20 mixed helium/oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect .
Ear/Nose/Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake .
The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases , although these did rise to 816 .
MB was negative .
She was treated with captopril for hypertension , and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge .
She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size , and no significant valvular disease .
She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath ; however , she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema , as she experiences discomfort with this , and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance .
3. ENDOCRINE :
She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house .
She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge .
This should be followed up by her primary care physician .
4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture ; however , her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection , and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h.
3. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h.
4. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h.
5. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper .
6. Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
Dyazide was discontinued .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
Discharge services included visiting nursing which was to assess in her inhaler technique , monitor her fasting blood sugars , as well as her blood pressure , monitor her peak flows , and assess her mobility and activities of daily living at home .
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :
She was also to seek the next available appointment with Dr. Jeanette Barr or to see another resident in the Saint Vincent Hospital Clinic if she cannot get an appointment within one week .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Condition on discharge was good ..
CODE STATUS :
Full code .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 year-old gentleman with severe aortic stenosis , reports having been told he had a heart murmur many years ago but just recently diagnosed with aortic stenosis .
He has had mild dyspnea on exertion increasing over the past couple of months prior to admission .
An echocardiogram in 2011-09-05 revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 25% .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Cigarette smoking .
2. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
3. Proteinuria .
4. Aortic stenosis .
5. Cellulitis .
6. Gangrene of his left second toe in 2010-06-06 followed by an amputation .
7. Left common femoral dorsalis pedis bypass graft .
8. Right leg bypass graft in 1999 .
9. Right below the knee amputation in 2008 .
ALLERGIES :
The patient states he has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
1. Aspirin 325 mg po q day .
2. Vasotec 7.5 mg po q day .
3. Humalog insulin sliding scale with meals and at bedtime .
4. Humulin Walters insulin 24 units subcutaneous q A.M. and 8 to 16 in the evening depending upon where his blood sugar has been .
Preoperative laboratory values were unremarkable .
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-17 which revealed a 20% left vein osteal lesion as well as 70% LAD lesion and an 80% right coronary .
The patient was taken to the operating room on 2011-10-18 where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with #23 mm pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft times two with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein to the acute marginal .
Postoperatively the patient was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Milrinone , Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drip .
The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated on the night of surgery .
He remained on Levophed , Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips and was hemodynamically stable .
N. Saez clinic consult was obtained due to hyperglycemia and the need for insulin drip in the Intensive Care Unit .
On postoperative day the Milrinone was weaned down .
The Levophed had been discontinued as the Neo-Synephrine and the patient was beginning to progress hemodynamically .
Upon discontinuation of the Milrinone the patient 's SV02 had dropped significantly in the low 50 s.
The patient had decreased exercise tolerance and therefore was placed back on his milrinone to keep his cardiac index greater than 2.0 .
Over the next couple of days it was very slowly decreased as his Ace inhibitors were increased orally .
The patient ultimately was weaned off the Milrinone , transitioned to Captopril on postoperative day five and remained hemodynamically stable .
Once the patient had remained off of inotropics for approximately 24 hours , he had been given diuretics and Ace inhibitors and remained hemodynamically stable he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor on postoperative day six .
A physical therapy evaluation was obtained for assistance and mobility .
Cardiac rehabilitation was initiated at that time .
On 2011-10-24 postoperative day six consultation heart failure cardiology service was obtained .
It was their recommendation to continue Ace inhibitors , to continue daily weights , to switch the patient to a long acting beta-blocker and to enroll the patient in postoperative cardiac rehabilitation as well as to make sure the patient was on statin drugs .
These measures were all instituted .
The patient continued to progress from cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy standpoint while on the floor .
The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days , continued to increase with physical therapy and ambulation .
His blood sugars were followed by the Cape Cod Hospital Clinic service and insulin has been adjusted accordingly .
Today , 2011-10-31 , postoperative day 13 the patient remains stable and ready for discharge to home .
The patient 's condition today is as follows :
Temperature 96.9 F , pulse 84 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 106/59 .
Most recent laboratory values are from 2011-10-25 which revealed a white blood cell count 8.4000 , hematocrit 35 , platelet count 202,000. Sodium 133 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 93 , CO2 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 198 .
The patient 's finger stick blood glucose levels range from 151 to 390 over the past 24 hours and his insulin scale has been adjusted upward to compensate for that .
Neurologically the patient is grossly intact .
Pulmonary exam he is clear upper lobes , diminished bilateral bases left greater than right .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Acute inferior myocardial infarction and right ventricular infarction .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old Caucasian-speaking woman with a history of hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use who developed waxing and waning left substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder on 2011-11-17 which lasted that entire day .
Upon waking on the morning of admission , she had 10/10 chest pain associated with nausea .
She presented to Charlton Memorial Hospital Hospital Emergency Department with inferior ST elevations ; at which time she became acutely hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 to 80 after receiving one ublingual nitroglycerin .
She then became bradycardic which responded to atropine and intravenous fluids .
In addition , she was given aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and morphine .
Immediately prior to transfer to Worcester State Hospital , she went into ventricular fibrillation arrest at 12:30 p.m. , at which time she was intubated and defibrillated back to sinus rhythm after five shocks .
She received an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg intravenously and was continued on an amiodarone drip while CMED CSRU-flighted to Boston Regional Medical Centerr where she underwent a catheterization .
The cardiac catheterization revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse right coronary artery disease .
She received three stents to the right coronary artery which was complicated by a proximal dissection .
She had good post percutaneous coronary intervention angiographic results .
Incidentally , an aortogram during the catheterization revealed a Debakey class I aortic ascending aneurysm , and the patient had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 at the time of catheterization .
She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in stable condition and still intubated .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypercholesterolemia .

She came from Czech Republic 14 years ago .
She works as a nursing assistant in a nursing home .
She smokes approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Family history is not significant for any early history of coronary artery disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Examination on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed blood pressure was 100/57 , with a mean arterial pressure of 75 , heart rate was sinus rhythm at 75 , temperature was 97.6 , oxygen saturation was 99% on assist control with a tidal volume of 600 on 60% FIO2 , 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure .
In general , she was sedated at the time , responsive to stimuli , and was following commands .
She had moist mucous membranes .
Her carotids were 2+ bilaterally .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Her heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a faint second heart sound and second heart sound .
No audible extra heart sounds .
Her abdomen was obese and had positive bowel sounds .
It was soft and nontender .
She had peripheral edema with 2+ peripheral pulses bilaterally .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
Her laboratories at the time of transfer to Saint Vincent Hospital revealed white blood cell count was 11.5 , hematocrit was 42 on admission , platelets were 242 .
Chemistry-7 was unremarkable .
Creatine kinase on admission was 309 , with a MB of 19.6 , an index of 6.3 , and an initial troponin of 0.73 .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
A chest x-ray revealed an enlarged mediastinum with clear lung fields bilaterally .
Initial electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 , normal axis , 2-mm ST elevations in lead III , 1-mm ST elevations in aVF and V1 , 1-mm ST depressions in I and aVL ; consistent with an inferior and right ventricular infarction .
Right-sided electrocardiograms showed 1-mm ST elevations in V4 ; consistent with a right ventricular infarct .
Electrocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 84 , with a
normal axis , and normalizing of the inferior ST segments , with Q waves evolving in leads III and aVF .
An echocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed an akinetic inferior wall and right ventricle , mild mitral regurgitation , and ascending aorta measuring 5 cm .
There was no effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM :
On the night of admission , the patient experienced post catheterization hypotension which required intravenous fluids and dopamine .
Electrocardiogram the following morning revealed normalization of her ST segments with evolution of Q waves .
Her dopamine was weaned off the following day , and her heparin was discontinued secondary to a right groin hematoma which had developed after the sheath had been pulled out by the fellow .
Her creatine kinases climbed ; reaching a peak of 3523 , which was down to 1500 at the time of discharge .
Also noted on the day of 11-20 , the patient self-extubated herself .
For her coronary artery disease , status post catheterization , she was given Integrilin for 18 hours .
She was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor .
For her rhythm , amiodarone was discontinued as she was maintained in sinus rhythm after moving to the floor .
For pump , once transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit on 2011-11-20 , a beta blocker was begun at 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. b.i.d. which was titrated to 25 mg at the time of discharge .
Also , at the time of discharge , for increased afterload reduction , she was started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
On 2011-11-21 , the patient experienced atypical chest pain which was made worse with inspiration and movement .
It was not associated with any nausea or vomiting .
It did not radiate .
It was felt to be pain secondary to her self-extubation and noncardiac chest pain .
An electrocardiogram was checked which revealed no ST changes , and there was no increase in her downward trending creatine phosphokinases .
No further intervention was done .
The patient was treated with Tylenol orally as well as Ativan for anxiety that she had about going home .
She was pain free on the day of discharge .
Regarding her aortic ascending aneurysm , Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding further workup .
At their request , a CT scan of the chest with contrast was performed on the day of discharge .
Dr. Streeter from Cardiothoracic Surgery will follow up with the patient for further management in approximately one month as an outpatient .
His office will contact her to make that appointment .
2. PULMONARY SYSTEM :
As stated above , the patient self-extubated herself .
She complained of a sore throat which was likely the etiology of her atypical chest complaints .
This resolved with Tylenol and as needed doses of oxycodone .
Her lungs remained clear to auscultation bilaterally throughout the remainder of her hospital course .
At the time of this dictation , the CT of her chest was still pending .
The official result was not yet in .
3. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient 's electrolytes sere managed daily and repleted on an as needed basis .
She did receive intravenous K-Phos for a low phosphorous of 1.5 .
Her phosphorous rose appropriately to 3.6 at the time of discharge .

Brief Hospital Course :
Impression :
71 yo m w/ astrocytoma on xrt and chemotx , who p/w 1 wk h/o productive cough , sick contact , hypoxic , now intubated , w/ increasing infiltrates b/l .
1) Resp failure - pt admitted w/ primarily hypoxic respiratory failure .
Following admission to the floor the pt developed increasing hypoxia and somnolence , requiring intubation on HD 5 .
Pulm had previously been consulted and felt that presentation was c/w PCP , Joann started on Bactrim .
Previously treated for CAP as outpt but hypoxia continued to progress .
Similar lack of improvement w/ additional broad spectrum coverage following admission .
Pt underwent bronchoscopy on 11-22 following transfer to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation ( 7.25/52/70 on 100% NRB ) .
On admission to the ICU the pt ' steroid dose was increased to 8 mg bid 03-07 to a dead space measurement of 50% .
Pt did well in the ICU , w/ his respiratory status steadily improving and was extubated on
01-03 .
He was subsequently tranferred to the floor , where he continued to have a stable oxygen requirement .
Repeat CXR was unchanged from previously in the ICU ( official read noted mild CHF , but pt was continuing to autodiurese and has remained net negative everyday while on the floor .
On discharge the patient has stable O2 req , 90% on RA .
2) astrocytoma - grade II , as per d/w PMD , Dr. Holscher , pt has poor prognosis , but reasonable for ongoing treatment .
Pt has had two recent neg head CT s , so unlikely the etiology of the patient 's MS change .
Pt was continued on keppra during admission for sz px .
Initially he had been on lamotrigine but the was stopped in 10/12 when the pt was noted to be developing a new rash .
Decadron has been steadily tapered since arrival on the floor .
Now continued on 1 mg BID , to complete a 7 day course , which will be tapered to 1 mg qday on 01-15 , and subsequently to 0.5 mg qday x 7 days then to be discontinued .
The patient 's keppra should be continued for sz prophylaxis .
3) MS change - on admission pt was agitated , requiring restraints and antipsychotics , however as he became increasingly hypoxic he became somnolent .
In the ICU the pt remained stuporous , responsive to painful stimuli .
On the floor the patient intially was imporved , but has plateaued , responding to simple commands and verbalizing groans but no real speech .
Improvement has correlated w/ tapering of steroids , one of the causes in the differential .
Pt had multiple head CT s which ruled out progression of astrocytoma .
MRI has been deferred given that the pt currently would not tolerate the procedure .
EEG was w/o evidence of epileptiform activity and c/w toxic encephalopathy .
Plan to continue to follow MS , expect improvement as steroids are continued to be tapered .
4) h/o DVT - cont heparin , previously on enoxaparin x10 days at treatment dose , followed by prophylactic dose .
On admission , the pt was started on treatment doses of enoxaparin .
Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit the pt was started on heparin gtt .
Course was c/b one episode of gross hematochezia on 12-28 , w/ concomitant hct drop of ~ 3 pts .
B/L lower ext duplex us and a cta were performed , both of which were negative .
Given that the pt was w/o evidence of DVT it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation in the setting of gross GIB , outweigh the risks of undetected deep vv thrombosis/pe .
Pt was continued on prophylactic heparin .
4) hypersensitivity reaction - on 11-24 pt was noted to have developing rash of abdomen and anterior thighs .
Derm initially reviewed and thought that it was not c/w hypersensitivity rxn .
Over the next the rash progressed , and the patient subsequently began spiking fevers to approx 103 F , c/b hypotension requiring aggressive fluid repletion and pressors , and tachycardia to the
130s .
The patient also developed elevated transaminases and pancreatic enzymes during this time .
On the second day that the rash had been noted , Derm was asked to see again , felt c/w hypersensitivity , bactrim was switched to pentamidine , and lamictal was held .
Pt continued to have elev pancreatic enzymes and pentamidine was switched to clinda/primaquine .
Following discontinuation of the bactrim the patient defervesced , and remained normotensive .
He received one dose of furosemide in the ICU and was transferred to the floor the next day .
On arrival to the floor the patient was noted to have a lacy reticular rash of upper arms , which resolved over the next 48h .
Felt likely 03-07 the sulfa moiety of the furosemide .
Plan for pt to complete total of 28 day course of therapy for PCP , James will be completed on 01-16 .
5) Anemia - previous w/u c/w ACD ( elev ferritin , low transferrin saturation ) .
- transfuse threshold < 24
6) ARF - Cr mildly elevated on tx to ICU , u lytes c/w prerenal azotemia , which resolved w/ IVF .
7) hyponatremia - also hyponatremic on transfer , resolved w/ ivf .
8) CAD - w/ abnl EF , however pt tolerated aggressive fluid resusciation w/o significant hypoxia .
Continued on valsartan , BB continued , statin
9) Nutrition - pt was maintained on TFs via post-pyloric
10) Px : Heparin ( full dose ) , IV PPI
11) Comm : Family very involved at bedside , evaluating rehab today
17) DNR , but may intubate for reversible causes
18) Restraint

Patient was continued on her Toprol , her lisinopril , and her digoxin .
Patient 's Coumadin was held for right heart catheterization and biopsy , and then EP study with ICD placement .
Patient did have Woodrow Betty , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody sent for further workup of the etiology of her cardiomyopathy .
The Courtney , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody were all negative .
Her CKs did trend down over the course of her hospital stay , and in the setting of her known clean coronaries on cardiac catheterization in 2011-11-19 , it was believed that a myocarditis might be the cause of her elevated cardiac enzymes and also could have exacerbated her congestive heart failure .

Brief Hospital Course :
A : 39 year old male w/ HTN , chronic LBP on narcotics presents after being found unresponsive at home .
P :
1) Unresponsiveness : This is likely due todrug overdose ( known oxycontin use , (+) BNZ on tox screen ).
Ddx : cardiac ischemia ( no ischemic EKG changes noted ), seizure w/ post-ictal state , CVA ( head CT neg ).
His cardiac enzymes include only elevated CK , but not Shaffer , Juan he ruled out for MI .
His mental status gradually improved from 03-23 to 03-24 .
He was able to communicate appropriately as his level of narcotic medications waned in his blood .
He was able to maintain a stable mental level for extubation on 03-24 .
As of 3/21 , he was alert , appropriate and answers questions and follows command on exam .
2) Pulmonary infiltrates : THere was initially concern that he was developing ARDS from aspiration pneumonia in the setting of being found unconscious .
He was intubated and was on mechanical ventilation from 9/13-10/11 , but he was started on levofloxacin 
and flagyl for total of 4 days .
ON 03-26 , his antibiotics were started as this most likely represent a transiet aspiration episode and not ARDS .
3) Airway protection : He was intubated in the field for airway protection
He was extubated on 03-24 and was weaned off oxygen slowly from 03-24 to 03-26 without significant event .
4) Hypertension : He was restarted on his atenolol and verapamil once his blood pressure stabilized on 03-25 .
5) Depression : He was restarted on his paxil on 03-25 and was given 1:1 sitter for suicidal ideation leading up to his suicide leading up to this admission .
He has not had further episodes while he was in the hospital .
- plan to restart Paxil when taking PO
6) Hyperglycemia : Although he has no known history of  diabetes , his elevated FS noted in field with glycosuria prompted fingerstick check but he has not required insulin coverage .
7) High amylase : He was admitted on 03-23 with elevated amylase but non-elevated lipase .
This likely is not concerning of pancreatic process .
His amylase trended down .
He was restarted on regular diet on 4/14-4/17 after his extubation

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59 year old male with a past medical history significant for an atrioseptal defect repair at age 18 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% and a recent cardiac myocardial infarction , pulmonary hypertension and mitral regurgitation , and atrial fibrillation .
He was seen by his primary care physician the day before admission and complained of two weeks of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue , weight gain and abdominal fullness .
He was sent to the Emergency Department for further evaluation .
The patient reported feeling at his baseline with chronic mild dyspnea on exertion until two weeks prior to admission .
During this period he had also been weaned off of his Digoxin starting early in February .
Over the two weeks prior to admission he had noticed an increasing heart rate from his baseline in the 60s to a heart rate in the 120s .
He had also some increased shortness of breath and a 10 pound weight gain and new three to four pillow orthopnea with a dry cough .
He denied fevers , chills , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or diaphoresis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Atrioseptal defect repair in 1970 , cardiomyopathy , right-sided congestive heart failure , pulmonary hypertension , history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter , history of prostate cancer , status post brachytherapy , history of rectal bleeding , obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP .
ALLERGIES :
ACE inhibitors , possible allergy to barium reported by the patient during a barium swallow 25 years ago .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 , discontinued one month prior to admission , Toprol XL 100 mg daily , Trazodone 50 mg once daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , Diovan 40 mg daily , Atrovent / Albuterol prn , Pulmicort , Coumadin 2.5 mg daily , Vitamin E , Vitamin C , iron supplement .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Remote history of tobacco , occasional alcohol use .
He is a retired fire fighter .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count 10.5 , hematocrit 38.1 , platelets 254 , INR 1.8 .
Sodium 140 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 38 , creatinine .7 , TSH 1.8 , Digoxin level less than 0.2 .
Serial cardiac enzymes negative .
ALT 14 , AST 31 , alkaline phosphatase 283 , total bilirubin 1.0 , amylase 71 , glucose tolerance test 317 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter .
Echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium , no atrioseptal defect , severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe left ventricular systolic function and moderately dilated right ventricle .
There was global hypokinesis apical throughout the right ventricle and abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume overload .
Moderate to severe 3+ mitral regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary early systolic hypertension .
Of note , this echocardiogram was performed when the patient was tachycardiac .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .
Upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .
Initially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .
However , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .
Therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .
It was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
The patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .
In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .
3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .
The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .
Chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .
The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .
In addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .
4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .
An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .
There was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .
Again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .
The patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .
It was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .
5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .
He did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .
He was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .
He fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .
His neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .
A computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .
6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .
The patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .
The remainder of the hospital course will be dictated by the covering intern .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on albuterol nebulizer treatments and Ipratropium nebulizer treatments , as this was apparently thought to be related to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Given the presence of consolidation on chest x-ray , however , and previous history of pneumonia , the patient was maintained on antibiotics of Zithromax 500 mg daily and ceftriaxone .
The patient was also started on Solu-Medrol IV for active airway disease component of her shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen and sputum production was maximized with the help of an Acapella device and respiratory therapy .
Mucomyst was also considered as a mucolytic component towards secretions .
Adrenal insufficiency .
The patient was maintained on IV Solu - Medrol 60 mg q. 8 h.
Chest soreness .
The patient describes chest discomfort without any significant EKG changes .
The patient was maintained on Percocet p.r.n. for pain relief .
This was thought to be related to musculoskeletal .
There was no evidence of acute rib factors on her chest x-ray .
GI .
The patient was maintained on PPI for reflux disease and known gastritis .
CMED .
The patient has a history of neurogenic bladder and , therefore , she required a Foley catheterization .
Endocrine .
The patient was on Levoxyl at home as her home dose for hyperthyroidism .
CMED CSRU transfer .
The patient was transferred on the evening of 2012-05-22 to the ICU given persistent carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis and the intermittent mental status changes .
The patient had had ABG on the floor , which prompted her to transfer to the ICU .
Her pH was 7.23 , PCO2 73 , PO2 146 on a nonrebreather .
The patient had BiPAP initiated once she reached the unit , but did not tolerate it , becoming apneic and obstructing .
The patient was switched to 2 liters nasal cannula and oxygen saturating at 98 to 100 percent .
After BiPAP was initiated , the patient became hypotensive down to 75/28 and bradycardiac , responding to 3 fluid boluses over the course of the night .
The patient was started on Florinef for concern of adrenal insufficiency ; however , she was hemodynamically stable that morning and was transferred back out to the floor .
It was thought that the patient may have been mucous plugging during her stay in the ICU .
Hematologic .
The patient has a history of high MCV and megaloblastic cells on smear in the setting of anemia ; question B12 deficiency , the patient also has a history of borderline low B12 levels .
The patient was diagnosed for B12 deficiency due to her long history of poor p.o. intake .
Methylmalonic acid levels were sent , the results are pending at the time of discharge .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
Asthma flare and bronchitis .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Demyelinating polyradiculopathy .
Anxiety disorder .
Chronic abdominal pain .

57 yo right handed male with seizure history since 1988 , s/p craniotomies x 3 ( most recently 05-05 ) for oligodendroglioma .
The patient began having generalized tonic - clonic seizures in 1988 , which at the time were thought to be related to asthma medications .
At this time , his head CT was negative , and he was treated with Dilantin and Phenobarbital .
However , he continued to have left arm focal motor seizures and problems thinking .
In 2001-08-31 he stopped his medication and had a generalized tonic - clonic seizure in 12/94 .
He was diagnosed by biopsy with oligodendroglioma , and gross total resection by Dr. Redner in
95 revealed a low-grade oligodendroglioma .
He was followed by Dr. Gregory Dumas , with serial MRI 's.
In 2011-05-02 , he was requiring more ativan to control his seizures , and was increasingly disoriented and forgetful with headaches .
He had a repeat total resection in 4/04 by Dr. Peter Hoadley at Hallmark Health System which revealed anaplastic oligodendroglioma grade III .
He had radiation following the resection and was doing well on monthly Temodar until 2012-04-23 when he had a marked change in behavior , his balance was off , speech slurred , and he had difficulty using the computer .
A head MRI on 2012-04-24 revealed increasing tumor infiltration with increased edema and mass effect .
He underwent a right craniotomy with resection and gliadel wafers on 2012-05-02 at Hallmark Health System by Dr. Ackley .
Came for neurosurgery follow up on 05-21 , and had been having clear fluid leaking from his incision , as well as frontal headache , imbalance , bumping into things with his left leg and worsening tremors .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 54 year-old female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets , history of PE , recent radiation therapy and steroids who presented in 2012-04-23 with myopathy presumed secondary to sterids , which have been given for her brain mets .
She was later sent to rehab , but returned early in April with increased cough with exertion with fever to 101 .
She was treated with Levaquin given her temperatures and differential diagnosis of increased PE burden load , infections or pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer .
The patient did not experience improvement in her symptoms and was readmitted on 06-11 with continued dyspnea and fevers .
Review of CTA showed no PE , but there was ground glass opacities on CT , so PCP was considered highly unlikely given her recent history of steroid use .
Her induced sputum was negative and BOL was done and also negative .
Sputum cultures were negative .
She was given Bactrim and she had improvement in the shortness of breath after her Bactrim was started and improved room air sats and was sent home on Bactrim .
She then continued to do poorly and then returned on 06-19 .
She presented on clinic on 06-20 with hypotension for which she was given intravenous fluids .
She spiked a fever to 103 with blood pressures hypertensive into the systolic 80 s and with rigors .
Chest x-ray showed a question of left lung opacity .
The patient was given Vancomycin and a gram of intravenous fluids .
Today , the patient was found in the bathroom and became hypoxic with saturations in the 80 s and was responsive to oxygen , but was still tachypneic without improvement and was placed on nonrebreather .
Currently the patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further medical care .
Currently the patient is short of breath without chest pain or dysphagia .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Breast cancer left side diagnosed in 1982 status post 1995 mastectomy with 5 out of 9 positive lymph nodes .
She was treated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant and then later with Tamoxifen from 2004 to 2001 .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is an emergency room physician at the Pauline .
She is married with three children .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit she is febrile with a low grade temperature of 100.1 , tachycardic to 110 , hypotensive 85/49 , tachypneic into the 50 s and 60 s, 95% on nonrebreather .
In general , she is extremely tachypneic , difficulty in speaking words .
Her heart is regular without murmurs , rubs or gallops , slightly tachycardic .
Her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases .
Abdominal examination was benign .
Extremities no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
She is alert and following commands .
LABORATORY :
White blood cell count 3.2 , hematocrit 26.6 , platelets 130 , chemistry is 131 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 105 , bicarb 17 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.5 , glucose 105 .
Calcium 7.3 , phos 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 .
She had a gas showing 7.36 , 31 , 96 .
She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Pulmonary :
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray .
The exact etiology of the patient 's respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial .
There was concern about possible pneumonia .
Also she had a history of PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast CA .
Given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz , Levaquin and __________ and Clindamycin .
Lab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for PCP Douglas .
The patient was initially trialed on BiPAP , but the patient was increasingly dyspneic , increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on 06-22 .
Earlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she underwent bronchoscopy , which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative .
Ultimately her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from BAL lavage were found to be negative .
The patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn .
Clindamycin and _______________ was discontinued early in hospital course .
Her PCP was thought to be negative .
In addition , Vancomycin , Levaquin were also discontinued .
She was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy .
As the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course went on the patient 's respiratory did not show mild improvement on the ventilator .
She was able to oxygenate originally .
Unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days .
Later in her Intensive Care Unit course family meetings took place and given the patient 's overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become CMO .
Subsequently she was extubated on 06-28 .
The patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory .
However , she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory distress .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient was initially transferred to the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology , respiratory distress and hypotensive .
She required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neo-synephrine .
Later during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back .
It was quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine .
She was also given stress dose steroids .
Later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads .
Her echocardiogram , however , was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology .
As mentioned above the patient 's hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine .
By 06-28 , however , the patient had been off of neo-synephrine , but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband / health care proxy .
3. Hematology :
Patient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from 2012-04-23 .
Earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient 's respiratory decompensation .
However , the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors .
She did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds , which were negative .
4. Infectious disease :
As mentioned above patient initially hypotension , febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary .
Initially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin , Ceptaz , Levaquin , Clindamycin and _________.
All of her cultures are negative to date .
She was negative for PCP and subsequently _____________ was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage .
In addition her Vancomycin and Levaquin were also discontinued .
The patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course .
By virtue of discussions on 06-28 the patient was deemed to be CMO and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point .
5. Gastroenterology :
The patient had an abdominal CT earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course , which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology .
She was initially supported with tube feeds during her Intensive Care Unit course , but at this point the patient is CMO and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued .
DISPOSITION :
The patient 's attending physician was in constant communication with the patient 's health care proxy her husband .
As her Intensive Care Unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement , continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status .
Ultimately it was decided by 06-28 that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status , it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward CMO care .
Subsequently all antibiotics , blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn .
Currently she is comfortable with morphine and Ativan prn.
Currently plans are in the making for arranging for the patient to have home hospice care .
Please see discharge addendum for further developments in the patient 's care .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a half to one pack per day smoker for 10 years who quit approximately one week prior to her admission .
She denies alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
Physical examination at the time of admission revealed she was in no acute distress .
Blood pressure was 150/79 , a pulse of 81 .
She is legally blind .
She was without any adenopathy .
Her chest was clear to auscultation .
Heart had a normal S1 and S2 , with no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Her abdomen was soft with well-healed incisions .
There was no organomegaly .
Extremities were without edema .
She had a functioning arteriovenous fistula with a thrill and a bruit in her left arm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room .
She underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa .
The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder .
Otherwise , there were difficulties , and estimated blood loss was minimal .
She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine .
Intraoperatively , for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and Solu-Medrol .
She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period .
She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir , as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative .
The patient 's initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful .
Her creatinine , which was 5 initially postoperatively , slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 .
She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin .
Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course , and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 .
She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids .
On postoperative day three , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents .
It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200/120 .
Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes , but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally .
Serial enzymes were drawn , and Cardiology was consulted .
With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction , the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit .
Throughout this time , her creatinine continued to drop , and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode .
Her beta blocker was progressively increased , and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down .
Two days after this event , she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis .
This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction .
Clinically , she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge .
She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
She was set to be discharged to home on 11-28 , on postoperative day seven .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Prograf 4 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( this may change depending on her most recent Prograf level which will be drawn on the morning of 11-28 ) .
2. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. CellCept 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a direct admission to the operating room on 02-12 , at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement .
Please see the operative report for full details .
In summary , she had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve .
She tolerated the operation well , and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit .
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period , however , her blood pressure remained somewhat labile .
Therefore , she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110 .
In addition , she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed , and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator , she developed a respiratory acidosis .
She therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one .
On postoperative day two , the patient remained hemodynamically stable .
Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned to off .
She was again weaned from the ventilator , and successfully extubated .
Her chest tubes were discontinued and , at the end of the day , she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .
After being transferred to the floor , the patient did well .
Over the next several days , her activity level was increased with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing staff .
She remained hemodynamically stable .
Her respiratory condition remained stable and , on postoperative day four , she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical
therapy .
At the time of transfer , the patient 's physical examination is as follows :
Vital signs :

Chief Complaint : abdominal pain / nausea
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Intubation
IR guided nephrostomy placement
History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 78 y/o WF w/a PMH significant for HTN and afib who presented to an OSH w/ complaints of abd pain and nausea .
She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant hydronephrosis and was transferred to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for ureteral stent placement .
Her INR was found to be elevated when admitted and , in the course of waiting for this to normalize , the patient spiked a temperature to 105 and became hypotensive to the 70s .
She was bolused w/out effect and had little response to neo so she was changed to levophed , given doses of cipro / vanco / gent and transferred to the CMED CSRU for management .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24 hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since this time .
She was restarted on heparin prior to d/c as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin anticoagulation .

3) Small bilateral pleural effusions .
4) Coronary artery calcification .
ECHO 2013-02-19 :
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated .
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
78 year old female with history of HTN , a.fib presenting with ureteral stone , hydronephrosis , and urosepsis .
She originally had hypotension and a leukocytosis in the ER and was admitted to the CMED CCU .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem on the day of call-out .
1. Sepsis - The patient was septic in the ER and her blood cultures eventually grew proteus .
Her Bcx remained negative throughout her stay .
She was treated with levaquin on the floor and will complete a 14d course at rehab .
She has been afebrile since she was called out to the floor .
2. Ureteral stone - The patient had a nephrostomy tube placed by IR to relieve her hydronephrosis .
She was followed by urology during her stay and will see them again 2 wk after d/c for definitive treatment of her nephrolithiasis .
At this time , urology will coordinate removal of her nephrostomy tube with IR .
Her nephrostomy tube was draining clear yellow urine at the time of d/c .
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled with beta blockers at home .
She was treated in the CMED as above .
Once on the floor , the patient had one episode of afib w/ RVR that responded immediately to IV metoprolol .
Because of this , the patient 's diltiazem was stopped and she was started on tid metoprolol .
After this , the patient had no further problems with her rate control .
She was maintained on a heparin gtt for bridge to coumadin while on the floor after this was cleared by IR and urology .
She will be d/c w/out her heparin as she is trending upwards with her INR and has no MR Paul Paquettec heart disease .
She will continue her coumadin at rehab to achieve an INR between 03-22 .
4. delirium - The patient had troubles with agitation while in the CMED CCU .
She received prn haldol w/ little effect and improved as her infection cleared .

He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department .
He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan .
CT examinations of the head , chest , abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable .
Initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low .
Subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube .
The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability , ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Hypertension .
2) Chronic low back pain , s/p lumbar discectomy x 2 .

Urine toxicology screen was negative .
Serum toxicology screen was positive for TCA s.
Tylenol level was 15 .
Alcohol level was 199 .
Initial blood gas was 7.31/46/500/77 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission .
No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization .
CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26 , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen .
Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest , remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability , he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours .
This was done , however , as in problem number two below , we were not successful in any neurologic recovery .
Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia , the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids .
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity .
Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively , loaded with multiple drugs , including Ativan and Propofol drips .
The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this .
He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma .
After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb , the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed .
Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay , the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 .
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , pneumonia , and urinary tract infection .
For all these infections , the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission .
Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 .
Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10 , however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin .
Ultimately it was decided that the patient 's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only .
With these goals of care , the patient expired on 2013-05-11 .
The family did consent to a postmortem examination .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
Cardiac arrest .
Anoxic brain injury
Status epilepticus
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia .

She then suffered rigidity with jaw clenching and tongue biting secondary to Fentanyl administration and was transferred to the CMED CCU for close observation .
She did well overnight in the CMED CCU .
She was started on Ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl .
Her liver function tests and amylase and lipase were followed closely .
On the second hospital day the patient was doing much better and was stable from an airway perspective , so she was transferred to the General Medical Floor .
1. Gastrointestinal :
As stated the patient was status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent
placement for a bile leak from the duct of Luschka .
The patient was continued on Ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl , which had been started at the time of transfer to the CMED CCU .
She had waxing and waning fevers .
However , her white blood cell count was never really elevated and she did not have a bandemia .
On the day of transfer to the General Medical Floor the patient had received clear liquids .
She did not tolerate this very well .
Her amylase and lipase on the day following the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
were elevated .
Amylase was 2304 with lipase being 7116 .
Therefore she was made NPO and given aggressive intravenous hydration .
On the second hospital day on the General Medical Floor the patient had marked rebound to palpation of her abdomen .
She was followed closely with serial abdominal examinations .
Her amylase and lipase were trending down , however .
An abdominal CT was obtained , which showed only mild pancreatitis .
There were no intra-abdominal fluid collections , which required any drainage .
On the third hospital day the patient 's pain was improving and the rebound was decreasing .
Her enzymes continued to trend down .
She received clear liquids in the evening and tolerated these well .
On the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a BRAT diet without significant abdominal
pain .
She had no further rebound .
She had no temperature spikes in greater then 24 hours at the time of discharge .
2. Hematology :
The patient 's hematocrit was 34.8 at the time of admission .
It decreased to 30 in the setting of aggressive hydration .
It remained stable at the time of discharge and it was 29.5 on the day of discharge .
3. FEN :
The patient was aggressively hydrated given that she was NPO .
She required periodic repletion of her potassium .
Her bicarb began to drop and she developed an anion gap acidosis .
This was most likely secondary to ketoacidosis as she had no dextrose in her intravenous fluids .
This was added on the evening prior to discharge and on the day of discharge her anion gap acidosis had resolved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Levaquin 500 mg one po q day times seven days .
2. Protonix 40 mg po q day .
3. Percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn .
The patient was given a prescription for ten pills .
4. Prempro as the patient was formerly taking .
5. Trazodone at bedtime .
DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP :
The patient was to make an appointment with Dr. Nicholson within one to two months after discharge for removal of the stent .
In addition , she would follow up with her primary care physician within one to two weeks following discharge .
She was to continue on a BRAT diet over the weekend and two days after discharge she could advance to a low fat no dairy diet .
She could slowly advance back to a normal diet over the next week .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis .
2. Anemia .
3. Hypokalemia .
4. Anion gap acidosis .
5. Bile leak .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In brief , the patient is a 64 - year-old male with a significant history for coronary artery disease , status post three myocardial infarctions and also status post five vessel coronary artery bypass graft in ' 89 and status post multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties who recently had a catheterization done in Mississippi and stent placed in 2013-03-24 .
The patient did well until approximately three to four weeks prior to presentation when he began to experience increased dyspnea on exertion .
One week prior to presentation , he had chest pain leading to a repeat catheterization at Springfield on 07-30 which showed narrowing of the stent and an ejection fraction of approximately 20% .
No intervention was done at that point .
On the evening prior to admission , the patient was awoken with chest pressure radiating to the neck anginal
equivalent which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin .
This episode happened three times that night and finally on the fourth re-awakening , the patient presented to the Emergency Department at Springfield and was transferred to the Faulkner Hospital for coronary revascularization .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 25 - year-old gentleman who is status post a motor vehicle accident in which he was the unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole .
He was ejected from the car and landed on his face .
Extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders .
It was presumed high-speed motor vehicle collision .
The patient was CMED-flighted to Quincy Medical Center , and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department .
After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation , a CT scan was performed .
Images of his head , abdomen , and thorax were obtained .
His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures , a right temporal fracture , bilateral frontal contusions , and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma .
The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells , presumably caused air in the orbit .

He was intubated with multiple abrasions , and severe swelling and contusions of his face .
He was not following commands .
His Boston Coma Scale was 16 .
His pupils were reactive on the right going from 3 mm to 2 mm of light .
The response was brisk .
On the left , his pupils went from 2.5 mm to 2 mm , also brisk .
Initial evaluation revealed corticate posturing was noted by the trauma team .
He withdrew equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .
He withdrew to noxious stimuli equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. NEUROLOGY :
Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay .
Upon arrival , Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt .
This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .
Notably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .
During his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .
To do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .
While using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .
In addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg .
A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .
Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .
Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .
During his hospitalization , two subsequent CAT scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .
This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .
After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .
His intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .
An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three .
This examination was unchanged from the previous examination .
Again , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As described in previous section , Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .
This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .
Please see Infectious Disease section for more details .
3. GASTROINTESTINAL :
Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .
A orogastric tube was passed .
Initially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .
However , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .
This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .
Gastroenterology was consulted for this .
Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .
At this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.
4. HEMATOLOGY :
Throughout Mr. Richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .
As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .
Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .
He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .
An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .
5. ENDOCRINE :
Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .
His blood urine and sputum were all cultured .
Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .
His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli .
Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .
Throughout this time , Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .
During his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and Flagyl .
Initially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .
He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl .
Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .
With a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .
Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .
7. PULMONARY :
As discussed in the Infectious Disease section , Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from Escherichia coli .
For this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
On hospital day three , Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .
For this , a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .
On hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .
For this , a left #34 Caucasian chest tube was placed .
On the evening of hospital day four , Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .
Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated .
The measures included attempts at pacing .
Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .
He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .
During the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .
There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .
During this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .
A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present .
After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .
Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .
After the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .
Permission for a postmortem examination was granted .

NOTE :
The Discharge Date of 2013-09-17 is pending .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Briefly , this 68 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , was admitted originally to the Podiatry Service for a left patellar mid-foot ulcer .
He underwent angiogram on 2013-08-28 , to evaluate his circulation and found at that time that the patient had a poor circulation to the left leg .
The patient was transferred to the Vascular Surgery Service for bilateral iliac stenting at that time .
The patient also at that time was followed by Cardiology and for preoperative evaluation had a stress test which was positive and he became diaphoretic but denied any chest pain .
Atropine was given and heart rate returned to the 70s and his blood pressure returned to the 120s over 80s .
The patient denied any orthopnea , shortness of breath , chest pain , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or cough .
He had occasional leg swelling .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1 . Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in 2006 and 1997 and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times two .
2. Diabetes mellitus type 2 since age 25 ; now currently on insulin , which is complicated by peripheral neuropathy , nephropathy and Charcot 's foot .
3. Chronic renal insufficiency .
4. Peripheral vascular disease status post left iliac stent and right femoral stent .
5. Hypertension .
6. High cholesterol .
7. Question of tendonitis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Insulin 70/30 , 40 units q. a.m. and 40 units q. p.m.
2. Diovan 160 mg p.o. q. day .
3. Nortriptyline 25 mg p.o. q. h.s.
4. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day .
6. Hydrochlorothiazide , 15 mg p.o. q. day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile ; his vital signs were stable .
His neck was supple ; he had no jugular venous distention .
His carotids were two plus bilaterally without bruits .
His lungs were clear .
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
His abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Bowel sounds are present .
He had bilateral femoral bruits and he had one plus popliteal pulses .
His pedal pulses are absent .
LABORATORY :
On admission , his BUN was 13 , creatinine 1.7 , hematocrit 43 and the cholesterol was 208 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is admitted to this hospital through the Podiatry Service ; however , the stress test showed multi-vessel disease .
Podiatry continued to follow for evaluation of his left foot ulcer .
At the time of discharge , he was having acetic acid wet-to-dry dressing changes , 0.25% q. day .
Vascular Surgery was following at the same time and decided that bilateral iliac stenting would be the most optimum treatment currently and suggested that the patient should be worked up for cardiac disease prior to re-vascularization .
Medicine was also consulted at that time for high blood pressure and for the biceps pain .
While having angiography , he had a transient increase in his blood pressure and became diaphoretic and thus precipitated the evaluation for cardiac disease .
Cardiology was consulted at that time to evaluate his heart .
The patient was managed on the Medical Service for his drop in blood pressure and cardiac evaluation .
He was also followed by Podiatry and Vascular Surgery .
He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory which showed multi-vessel disease and Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2013-09-04 , where a coronary artery bypass graft times four was performed , left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to diagonal , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to PC by Dr. Wright .
The patient was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively where he did well .
He was slowly weaned from his ventilator and was able to be extubated .
The patient was able to be weaned to six liters nasal cannula after extubation , however , it was noted on chest x-ray that he had a small apical pneumothorax .
A repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of that pneumothorax .
The patient was continued on an insulin drip for his diabetes mellitus but continued to improve .
His chest tube was in place for a high chest tube output .
His Foley catheter was removed and the patient was transferred to the Floor .
Physical Therapy was consulted in order to assess the patient 's ambulation and mobility , however , with his foot infection and associated pain , it was difficult to assess at that time .
After arriving on the Floor , the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and Lopressor .
The patient resolved , however , Lasix was also given due to some pulmonary edema and increasing oxygen need .
The patient continued to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation while on the Floor , which required continued diuresis as well as intravenous Lopressor .
His chest tube and Foley catheter were removed on postoperative day number three , and the patient had aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments .
His dressing changes for his foot continued per the Podiatry Service and his leg ulcer was noted to be slowly healing .
The patient had multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation which again required intravenous Lopressor .
Amiodarone boluses were given and the patient was started on 400 three times a day of p.o. amiodarone , aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis was done , however , the patient continued to have respiratory difficulties when in rapid atrial fibrillation .
The patient was evaluated on postoperative day number five and it was decided at that time that the patient should be transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory difficulties .
He was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he was aggressively diuresed as well as his rate was controlled and chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments were done .
The patient improved slowly .
Also , his white blood cell count was found to rise to 32.0 ; this was most likely due to a secondary infection of his foot and Zosyn was started .
The patient continued to do well and his recurrent atrial fibrillation slowly improved ; p.o. doses of Lopressor slowly increased to get better control of his rate and the patient was able to be controlled with a heart rate in the 50s to 60s with Lopressor .
Following initiation of his Zosyn , the white count continued to improve and the patient was planned for a PICC line for long-term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient was started on Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice a day with good control with a heart rate of 50s to 60s .
He is in sinus rhythm .
He was also started on his preoperative medications of Amlodipine and Losartan with improvement of his blood pressure .
The patient was also reduced to 400 mg q. day of amiodarone .
Pulmonary was consulted at this time for this difficulty of diuresis and pulmonary edema .
They continued to agree with the management of the patient and with aggressive pulmonary toilet as well as diuresis and nebulizer treatment .
The patient was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on 2013-09-13 , and upon arriving on the floor , he continued to do well .
Pulmonary toilet and aggressive chest Physical Therapy was continued and the patient was able to be weaned from his oxygen .
Furthermore , his Foley catheter was removed and he was started on anti-coagulation for his episodes of atrial fibrillation .
He had been started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit and that was continued .
Coumadin was then begun with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
At that time he was stabilized from a cardiac perspective .
Podiatry and Vascular Surgery were reconsulted to assess the patient 's needs for revascularization and for his foot ulcer .
It was decided at that time that the patient could be discharged in follow-up with Vascular Surgery for revascularization and Podiatry thereafter .
On 2013-08-28 , the patient had a PICC line placed for a six week course of intravenous Zosyn for his foot ulcer and his Coumadin was also continued .
The patient did well and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility at that time .
His discharge date is pending .

Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment and Plan :
This is a 79 y/o M with h/o HTN , DM , recent CVA , chronic ventilatory failure , CRI on HD who presents with change in MS and febrile in the Amanda , admitted to CMED .
# Altered mental status : Ct scan with no evidence of new intracraneal bleeding .
Patient febrile in the Amanda .
High WBC .
It was thought that it could have been a combination of hypotension , hypercapnia and infection .
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics .
Despite having a profund limitation communicating given his neurological status , his mental changes seemed to improved initially .
However later on during his course , his mental status deteriorated , being even less responsive .
# ID :
Patient febrile and with a high WBC on admission .
After starting broad spectrum antibiotics - cefepime - vancomycin and flagyl ( for initial concern of aspiration pneumonia ), he responded clinically .
Urine cx from Rehab showed gram negative rods > 100 K enterobacter cloacae .
Urine Cx in house grew Citrobacter Freundi and his sputum grew Acinetobacter Baummani .
Since there was no more evidence of gram positive infections , vancomycin was discontinued and cefepime was kept .
# Fevers : in the Amanda , high WBC , possible pneumonia .
Also possible source sinus infections given findings on intial CT ( see summary in significant studies ). He did not spike any fevers after being transfer to the CMED from the Amanda .
# Resp : Patient was intermitentely switched from AC to Pressure support trials .
However , after Patient did well .
Then trach mask trials were done .
He tolerated this well , although he required PS overnight .
# ESRD on hemodyalisis : Renal service was consulted and HD was continued .
# CV :
Rhythm : NSR , not tachycardic .
Pump : With trace of lower extremity edema .
X ray suggested some pulmonary edema on admission .
Despite this findings , he was supported with 40% FIO2 most of the time .
CAD : On admission Ck low normal , MB not done .
Troponin 0.44. 
It was more likely due to CRI .
Second set 12 hours apart , showed no changes .
s/p stroke : continue aspirin , statin , plavix
# Hypotension : per referral form .
Intially concern for sepsis in the setting of fevers and high blood count .
His BP medications were held on admission .
Patient did not require pressors .
His blood pressure remained stable and BP meds were restarted .
# FEN :
Tube feedings were started thorugh peg tube .
On 2013-09-08 , patient pulled out peg tube .
Temporary foley was placed and on 2013-09-11 ,
On 2013-09-12 after deterioration of his mental status and also of his blood pressure , goals of care were discussed with his HCP .
It was decided to direct goals of care towards confort care .
Patient passed away accompanied by his significant other .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Large left middle cerebral artery stroke along with posterior cerebral artery strokes bilaterally .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 86 year old woman who has a history of atrial fibrillation , peripheral vascular disease , and a history of atrial emboli who was admitted on 2013-09-06 , to the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit service after collapsing at home at 8:30 p.m .
She was found to have right sided weakness and was noted by her husband to have vomited .
She was found comatose at home by EMS and was brought to the Emergency Department .
On arrival to the Emergency Department , she was noted to have a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 164/110 , respiratory rate 28 , and heart rate of 74 .
She was found to be responsive only to painful stimuli at this time .
She was intubated for airway protection and received multiple medications prior to her initial neurologic examination .
She was also noted to have a cold distal left upper extremity which was operated on and she is now status post left brachial artery embolectomy .
Throughout her course on the Intensive Care Unit service , she has remained unresponsive with imaging studies consistent with a large left middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery distribution cerebral infarction with mass effect and midline shift .
There is evidence of bilateral occipital and cerebellar infarctions as well .
Discussion with the patient 's family by the Intensive Care Unit service has resulted in focusing on her comfort care .
This decision was made after an extensive discussion with her husband and family as the likelihood of significant meaningful recovery is extremely low .
Based on this , she is transferred to the Neurology service for focus on comfort care .

CT CSpine :
No evidence of cervical spine fracture .
Cervical spondylosis as described above .
CXR post CVL placement 09-23 :
A left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the superior vena cava .
Several skin folds are present in the left hemithorax but there is no pneumothorax .
There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions , both of which have increased in size since the previous study .
New perihilar and basilar opacities may reflect pulmonary edema sparing the upper lobes in the setting of emphysema , but it is difficult to exclude underlying aspiration or infectious pneumonia in the lung bases .
Surgical clips are present in the left axilla .
09-25 CXR :
Interval development of large left pneumothorax with almost complete collapse of the left lung .
Brief Hospital Course :
79F w/ a multiple medical problems including Sylvia ( EF20% ) , COPD ( on home O2 ) , found down at home , pulseless - CPR initiated w/conciousness regained on scene .
At OSH ABG 7.19/94/110 , BiPAP started .
Pt found to be hypothermic w/ WBC 17 ( pt on steroids ) pnuemobilia and thickening of sigmoid .
Pt was transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics for further management with wishes from the pt and family to reverse DNR/DNI status if surgery was indicated .
On transfer , the pt had VSS with a mildly tender abdomen without peritoneal signs .
It was decided to treat her conservatively with bowel and IV antibiotics .
She improved and was tolerating PO 's without difficulty after passing a swallow study .
Her Cpine was clearly with both a negative CT Cspine and clinical exam .
Her groin CVL was DC 'd after a L SC SVL was palced .
CXR confirmed good position and no PTx .
Overnight on HD 3 , pt became mildly agitated and an ABG was drawn which showed a severe resp acidosis and BiPAP was initiated .
The pt subsequently developed severe hypoxia with hypotension .
A CXR was obtained which showed complete collapse of the L lung thought to be a result of bursting a bleb associated with her severe COPD .
Family did not want a chest tube placed and decided to make the pt CMO measures .
On HD 4 pt continued to show a severe respiratory acidosis , was continued on a morphine drip , and was difficult to arouse .
At 6pm pt 's respiratory status worsened and she died .

Brief Hospital Course :
Mrs. Mandelbaum was admitted and underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Larry Mckinney .
Of note , intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram evaluation showed only mild mitral regurgitation , so no repair/replacement was indicated .
Following the operation , she was brought to the CSRU .
On postoperative day one , she was noted to be largely unresponsive with left hemiparesis .
Restlessness with body tremors were also noted .
A stat MRI was notable for multiple abnormal foci consistent with systemic emboli .
These were found in the right cerebellar , occipital and anterior parietal lobes .
The neurology service was consulted and attributed these findings to cholesterol emboli .
Due to seizure activity , Dilantin was started .
Anticoagulation was not recommended .
Over the next several days , her neurological status slowly improved .
She was eventually extubated without incident .
She went on to experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with intravenous Amiodarone .
She concomitantly had loose stools which were C. diff negative .
Her clinical status stablized and she transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day six .
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm and transitioned to oral Amiodarone which will need to continue for three months postop .
She tolerated beta blockade which was slowly advanced as tolerated .
She worked daily with physical and occupational therapy .
Her neurological status continued to improve .
Acyclovir was eventually increased from her maintenance dose for a herpes zoster breakout on her right upper back .
In addition , she was empirically started on Flagyl for persistent diarrhea ( despite negative C. diff cultures ) , however she developed an additional rash on her buttocks after the first dose of flagyl , so the flagyl was discontinued .
She developed a urinary tract infection for which she was started on Bactrim .
A foley catheter was inserted given her mutiple episodes of incontinence that were adding to skin irritation .
On insertion she was found to be retaining 1400 cc of urine , so the foley catheter was left in .
She continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 10 .

Brief Hospital Course :
1) GI - In the Monica pt had Hct of 20 and bloody NG lavage which did not clear .
She was transfused 1U PRBC , GI consult called , also got zofran and iv protonix and admitted to the FICU .
On arrival to unit pt had EGD which revealed grade III esophageal varices with signs of old bleeding .
She was started on octreotide and nadolol to control portal htn .
Pt was stable and had appropriate Hct bump to 25 after 2U PRBC 's.
She also had climbing bilirubin and low grade temp and was started on Zosyn for suspected biliary obstruction and ascending cholangitis coverage .
She was rescoped on 10-28 and varices were sclerosed ( no banding due to latex allergy ) and diuretics of lasix and aldactone were readded for ascites since BP stable .
10-29 she was transfused another 3U PRBC 's with hct bump to 31.9 and antibiotic coverage broadend to Unasyn , Ceftriaxone , Flagyl because she continued to spike , and for SBP prophylaxis .
Preprocedure of PTC on 10-30 she was transfused 1 unit PRBC 's, 2 platelets and 2U FFP and procedure went without complication .
ON transfer to the floor she remained hemodynamically stable with stable Hct and declining bilirubin .
She remained afebrile so on 11-02 antibiotic regimen was weaned to only levofloxacin .
Liver teams recommended to repeat EGD with non latex banding in 7-10 days .
She also went home on naldolol 20 mg qd for portal htn , and her home doses of diuretics to control her ascites .
2. US finding - Pt was incidentally found to have R hydronephrosis and a R adenexal mass on her US .
The hydronephrosis was likely caused by blockage by her tumor .
Given her disease prognosis and the fact that her other kidney is functioning well , no intervention was done .
Also the adenexal mass may represent a second primary maligancy .
This was seen on a prior CT scan and her oncologist is aware .

2013-12-10
Date of Birth :
2013-11-01
Sex :

Service :
Neonatology
HISTORY :
Mychelia Boyd was born at 28-2/7 weeks gestation and delivered due to unstoppable premature labor .
Mother is an 18-year-old prima gravida , estimated date of delivery 2014-01-22 .
Prenatal screens include blood type O negative .
Other prenatal screens were unknown at time of delivery .
Pregnancy was uncomplicated until the day of delivery when mother presented to HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital Hospital with bleeding and was sent home .
She then presented to Jordan Hospital Hospital where she was noted to be 5 cm dilated with a transverse lie presentation .
She was given betamethasone times one and transferred to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital where she was delivered by cesarean section with rupture of membranes at time of delivery notable for slight meconium stained amniotic fluid .
The baby emerged with spontaneous cry , received routine care and then was intubated in the Delivery Room due to inconsistent respiratory effort and increased work of breathing .
Apgars were 6 at one minute and 8 at five minutes .
She was transferred to the newborn Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her admission physical revealed a birth weight of 901 gm , 20th percentile ; length 34 cm , 25th percentile ; head circumference 25 cm , 25th percentile .
Anterior fontanelle open , soft and flat .
Red reflex was difficult to appreciate bilaterally .
Pupils were large but equal and reactive .
Palate deferred due to oral intubation .
No defect noted during procedure .
Increased work of breathing prior to intubation , but presently comfortable .
Breath sounds slightly crackly , symmetric equal air entry .
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Peripheral pulses plus 2 and symmetric .
Abdomen soft without hepatosplenomegaly .
Three-vessel cord , clamped .
Normal female external genitalia .
Normal back and hips .
Skin was pink and well-perfused .
Appropriate tone and activity .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
Respiratory :
The baby was intubated in the Delivery Room , received two doses of surfactant .
Radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse granular pattern consistent with surfactant deficiency .
Maximum mechanical ventilation PIP 26 , PEEP 6 , rate of 25 , maximum FIO2 35 percent .
Mychelia was extubated to a CPAP of 6 cm on day of life two where she remained until day of life 20 .
On day of life two , she was also loaded with caffeine and continues on caffeine at time of transfer .
She was transitioned to a nasal cannula on day of life 20 and remains on nasal cannula O2 100 percent at 13 cc flow .
She averaged 2-3 apnea episodes a day with bradycardia and desaturations .
She has a comfortable respiratory rate and good air exchange .
Cardiovascular :
She received a normal saline bolus times one initially for poor perfusion and was started on dopamine with a maximum infusion rate of 6 mcg per kg per hour .
This was discontinued on day of life two to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 33 .
She has remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her hospitalization here .
Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition :
Initially maintained NPO .
UAC and UVC lines were placed upon admission to the CMED .
The UAC was left in place until day of life two and was removed after wean from dopamine .
UVC remained in place through day of life six and was utilized to administer parenteral nutrition .
Electrolytes and glucose remained in the normal range throughout the first week .
She was started on enteral feeds on day of life six with a slow advance secondary to increased abdominal girth which was felt to be due to CPAP .
She passed meconium .
She achieved full feeds on day of life 13 .
Calories were gradually increased to breast milk 30 calories with ProMod consisting of four of human milk fortifier , four of MCT and two of Polycose with a 12-28 teaspoon of ProMod per 50 ml of breast milk or 60 ml of formula .
On day of life six due to concerns for hyperglycemia and abdominal distention , sepsis evaluation was obtained .
She was noted at this time to have hyperglycemia requiring two subcutaneous doses of insulin and a decreased glucose infusion rate to achieve euglycemia .
This resolved that same day .
Urine output was always noted to be of sufficient quantity .
Gastrointestinal :
Mychelia demonstrated slow gastrointestinal motility and abdominal distention felt to be due to CPAP .
She was slow to advance on enteral feeds and gradually attained full enteral volume on day of life 13 .
On day of life 15 , she was made NPO for a distended abdomen and a bilious spit .
Serial KUBs revealed nonspecific changes with dilated loops .
No pneumatosis or free air was seen .
She was noted to have bluish discoloration thought to perhaps be a bruise on her left lower quadrant .
There was no radiographic correlation with this .
Feeds were restarted .
Again , she was advanced to full volume but was made NPO on day of life 20 for abdominal distention .
This NPO was temporary for that day and she then resumed feedings and has been tolerating full enteral feeds well , improved since off of CPAP , passing normal stools , guaiac negative .
Mychelia was also treated for physiologic jaundice .
She was started under phototherapy on day of life one through day of life three with a peak serum bilirubin of 4.7/0.3 .
This issue resolved .
Hematologic and Infectious Disease :
Initial CBC was notable for a white count of 5.5 with 49 polys , 1 band and 47 lymphs .
Initial hematocrit was 46.3 percent and platelets 320,000 .
Her initial blood culture remained negative and she received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin .
As previously noted on day of life six with hyperglycemia , abdominal distention , a CBC and blood culture were again obtained revealing a white count of 9.1 with 30 polys , 0 bands and 58 lymphs .
Hematocrit at that time was noted to be 31 and platelets 370,000 .
Blood culture grew staph coagulase negative and the baby received seven days of vancomycin and gentamicin .
A lumbar puncture was also performed to rule out meningitis .
This culture remained negative with normal cell counts and chemistries .
Antibiotic levels were monitored and doses adjusted accordingly .
Mychelia required two transfusions during her hospital stay .
On day of life 15 for a hematocrit of 29 , she received 20 cc of packed red blood cells .
She started on iron and vitamin E supplements on day of life 25 and continues on that at this time of transfer .
However , on day of life 34 , 12-04 , she was noted to be pale and less stress tolerant , mottling easily with care .
A hematocrit and reticulocyte count showed a hematocrit of 23 percent and a reticulocyte count of 1.9 percent .
Therefore , with blood available from the first aliquot , a second 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells were infused without incident .
Neurological :
Initial head ultrasound on day of life seven was normal .
At one month of age , on 12-03 , she was noted to have an absent septum pellucidum .
An MRI obtained and reviewed by the Hallmark Health System Radiology Department revealed focal gyral morphology consistent with prematurity , normal midline structures , normal myelination , no lesions , no signal abnormalities or extracerebral collections .
The cortical ribbon is intact .
The major vascular structures at the skull base are normal .
The septal leaflets may be partially absent , but there are no coronal images provided for confirmation and the pituitary stalk is present .
An Ophthalmology consult was obtained to determine the presence of optic nerves .
These were both determined to be present and intact .
Endocrine was also consulted .
Several labs were ordered .
Electrolytes and thyroid studies were noted to be in the normal range with serum sodium of 136 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 98 and CO2 34 .
She had a calcium of 10.3 , a phosphorus of 4.8 and alkaline phosphatase of 440 .
Thyroid function studies revealed a TSH of 2.2 , T4 of 5.7 , T3 of 101 and a cortisol level of 43 , all within the normal range .
A growth hormone was sent and the results were pending at time of transfer .
In addition , an FSH and LH were obtained on 12-10 and results are pending at time of transfer .
Please contact lab control at Mattapan Community Health Center for results : ( 409 ) 238-8236 .
The baby 's neurologic examination is appropriate for corrected gestational age which is 33 and 6/7 weeks on day of transfer .
By mother 's report , a maternal cousin also has an absent septum pellucidum .
Given normal pituitary tests thus far and normal optic nerve , no evidence of septic optic dysplasia .
Pediatrician should have low threshold for endocrinology reconsult if any signs of pituitary problems .
Sensory :
Audiology hearing has not yet been obtained .
This is recommended prior to discharge from hospital to home .
Ophthalmology :
Initial ROP screen was done on 12-02 and revealed immature retinas to zone 2 bilaterally .
They recommended follow-up examination due on the week of 12/20 .

Attending : Robert E Goldschmidt , M.D.
Addendum :
Just prior to discharge on 11-14 , pt 's BP was found to be 70/40 P70 s just after receiving her am BP meds .
She was asymptomatic .
The patient was kept in the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.
The hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .
All of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .
Infection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .
Given the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .
Her groin exam was unchanged .
Her Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .
Repeat hcts were stable .
The patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .
As volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .
She was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .
She tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .
She will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .
2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .
She was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .
The patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .
3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .
Stool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .
Her bowel regimen is prn .
Gastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .
There is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .
Therefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .
We have advised a BRAT diet .
4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .
However , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .
She also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .
Upon discharge the patient was changed to a BID protonix regimen .
Dr. Valerio office was notified about the patient 's discharge plans and status .
She will need outpatient follow up for her guiac pos stools with endoscopy vs EGD +/- H.pylori serologies .
A copy of this dc summary will be faxed to her PCP to ensure proper follow up .

CT head without contrast 2013-11-11 :
FINDINGS :
There is a large region of high attenuation within the right frontal lobe and the region of the right basal ganglia .
This is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage , more likely hypertensive in etiology .
No significant subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage is appreciated .
There is mass effect present with shift of the normally midline structures towards the left .
There is also left sided subfalcine herniation .
There is no hydrocephalus .
The visualized osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable .
IMPRESSION :
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe .
This most likely relates to hypertensive hemorrhage , as opposed to a ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm .
Brief Hospital Course :
Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin , coronary artery disease , hyperlipidemia , dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness , dysarthria .
Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral hemorrhage , centered around basal ganglia and putamen .
We felt this was likely secondary to hypertension .
While still in the emergency department , he had rapid decompensation necessitating intubation for airway protection .
Examination post intubation but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and brainstem compression .
The overall prognosis was guarded .
He was admitted to the Neurology / Neurosurgery ICU .
He was loaded with Mannitol and Dilantin in the emergency room .
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery service and they did not feel a surgical intervention or ventriculary drain was warranted .
After arrival in the ICU , patient was followed with neuro checks every 1 hour .
Sedation was held to allow for frequent exams .
Head of bed was kept at 30 degrees .
Labetalol continuous infusion was titrated for systolic blood pressure of 130-160 .
Mannitol and Dilantin were continued .
After lengthy discussion , the patient 's wife opted to make him DNR on afternoon of 2013-11-11 .
Overnight , fresh frozen plasma was given for goal INR of < 1.4 .
On serial exams by neurology and ICU attendings in the morning on 2013-11-12 , patient had no clinical signs of brainstem activity .
Namely , he was unresponsive .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
No corneal , gag , oculocephalic , and oculovestibular reflexes were elicited .
He was not overbreathing his ventilator .
At this point , patient was felt to have clinical signs consistent with brain death .
Plans were made to proceed with apnea testing .
However , after discussion with patient 's wife , this was postponed with test planned on 2013-11-13 .
Full medical care and managment continued overnight 11/9-11/20/2002 .
At approximately 06:00 on 2013-11-13 , the patient became bradycardic .
He lapsed first into a junctional rhythm and then had very infrequent ventricular escape beats on telemetry .
Finally , he went asystolic .
He was not resuscitated as per previous conversations with his wife .
Ronald was pronounced dead at 06:59 am .
The patient 's wife was notified .
The attending was notified as well .

Chief Complaint :
Chest Pain
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Removal of tunneled cath ( previously used for tPN )
History of Present Illness :
54 yo F with Crohn 's s/p ileostomy and subsequent short gut syndrome with port-a-cath placement for TPN who presents with progressive right sided chest pain that comes in waves .
The pt reports sharp 10/10 chest pain under the right breast which is getting progressively worse .
The pain is worsened with deep inspiration or movement .
It initially started one day previously but has gotten significantly worse over last 12 hours .
It is associated with SOB as well as fevers , chills .
The pt denies abd pain , n/v or increased ostomy output .
Given her fever , sx of chest pain and SOB as well as an elevated WBC count , she was initially thought to have a PNA .
She was therefore given ceftriaxone 1 g IV x1 and azithromycin 500 mg PO x1 in the Deanna .
As the CXR was without any evidence of PNA , or PTX , the pt subsequently received a CTA to evaluate for PE which revealed multifocal bilateral PNA but no PE .
At this time , she was given Vancomycin 1 g IV x1 .
She was also given morphine 2 mg x3 , 4 mg IV x2 , dolasetron 12.5 mg x2 and ativan 1 mg IV x1 .
Past Medical History :
1. Crohn 's disease , dx 1974 s/p three bowel resections and eventual ileostomy , resulting in short gut syndrome
2. Restless leg syndrome
3. ? Parkinsons vs. EPS side effects from risperdal
4. Chronic idiopathic pancreatitis , as demonstrated on CT in 09-01

7. Benzo and opiod addiction
8. Paranoia / Depression , h/o auditory hallucinations , ? mania
9. Port-a-Cath placement for IV hydration in setting of short gut syndrome , complicated by clotting x 4 , requiring replacement
Abd CT performed 09-01 showed multiple calcifications in the body and tail of the pancreas with a larger cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas .
A second 9 mm cystic lesion is seen in the head of the pancreas .
These findings are consistent with chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation

Brief Hospital Course :
54 yo F with Crohn 's disease s/p ileostomy with subsequent short gut syndrome with port-o-cath for TPN presents with acute onset pleuritic chest pain with fever , chills , and sob .
1. Chest pain / Fever / Chills :
The acute onset of chest pain was initially very concerning for a PE , however the Chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidation consistent with a bacterial PNA .
This is consistent with the remainder of the pt 's history including fever , chills , sob and an elevated WBC count .
The pt was given ceftriaxone / azithromycin / vancomycin in Deanna .
Blood , urine and sputum culutres were sent .
Pt 's blood cultures came back positive for Staph Aureus and Enterococcus , both were pansensitive .
Sputum culture also returned with Staph. Aureus .
Ceftriaxone and azithro were discontinued , and Vacomycin was continued .
Pt initially was hypoxic requiring NRB for O2 sat of 94% , with any attempt to wean she would desat .
Pt was intubated prior to tunneled catheter removal , see below .
( The tunneled catheter later came back for negative for culture. )
Earlier that day pt had a chest x ray which showed diffuse infiltrative process concerning for ARDS .
Post procedure pt remained intubated on ARDSnet protocol .
She self extubated the first day and was reintubated without any complications .
Her O2 requirement improved on the vent over the next few days and she was weaned off the vent on 2013-01-01 .
After extubation her o2 requirement was down to 1L NC with sats in mid 90s .
She was transferred to the floor for further managment .
The patient remained afebrile when she transferred to the medicine service .
She was weaned off the oxygen and for the remainder of her course her O2sats were stable on room air .
The patient had completed her antibiotic course while in house .
2. Hx of multiple port-o-cath clots :
Although the pt is on warfarin chronically , her INR was subtherapeutic .
Goal INR 01-31 .
Initially coumadin was increased , however given concern for infected line , general surgery was consulted who removed the line in the ICU .
3. ARF :
Pt initially with mild ARI , this was thought to be due to dehydration , after initial volume repletion her renal function improved to her baseline .
4. CMED :
The pt has a history of paranoia / depression .
ON admission she was taking Quetiapine 300 mg QHS and Clonazepam 1 mg QAM , 1 mg Q3PM , 2 mg PO QHS .
Quetiapine was continued however clonipin was initially held when she was intubated on fentynyl / versed .
This was restarted post extubation .
Intially after being transferred from the ICU to the medicine service the patient was mentating appropriately .
Her course later became complicated by visual and auditory hallucinations .
She made disturbing comments to the hospital personnel .
She was unable to sleep at night , often pacing the halls .
She required a 1:1 sitter .
Psychiatry was consulted .
They felt that her presentation was secondary to delirium and was multifactorial .
They attributed it to polypharmacy , recent infection ( pneumonia ) and insomnia .
A head CT was done which ruled out any acute processes .
The patient refused an LP .
They made recommendations for adjustments to her anti-psychotic medications .
At discharge the patient was on clonazepam 1 mg tid , seroquel 300 BID and neurontin 600 QAM , 1200 QPM and 1200 QHS .
The Kindred Hospital hospital course was prolonged because of her delirium .
Once her mental status improved she was discharged .
5. ? Parkinson 's Disease / Akithesia :
The patient was maintained Sinemet .
6. Pain :
In addition to her usual neuropathy pain , the pt initially appeared to have significant pain from the multi-focal PNA as well .
( Home regimen , Gabapentin 800 mg PO QAM , 1600 mg PO Q3PM , 1600 mg PO QHS .
This was held in the ICU and she was given diluadid prn for pain control .
The patient 's narcotic and CMED CCU regimen was evaluated by psychiatry during her delirium .
Please see above for their recommendations .
7. FEN :
Given her hx of ileostomy secondary to crohn 's disease and resultant short gut syndrome , the pt requires nutritional support via TPN .
After removal of tunneled line pt was given tube feeds while she was intubated .
The patient was transitioned to a low fat , low residue diet .

Of note , the patient 's daughter and son-in-law confirm his desire to be DNR/DNI , stating that they want him to be comfortable .
However , when asked if she thinks he would want comfort measures even if it meant that his respiratory status would worsen , the pt 's daughter says that he would not .
In particular , she feels that the pt would not want a morphine drip if it would negatively impact his respiratory function .

CXR :
IMPRESSION :
Focal consolidation in the medial aspect of the right lower lung
Brief Hospital Course :
This 86 yo man with h/o CVA , CHF , recent episodes of aspiration pneumonia , presented with dyspnea from his NH , likely from new RLL pneumonia .
He was started on Zosyn and Vanco for his presumed aspiration , "" hospital "" aquired PNA .
PE was considered but less likely given his fevers and clear pneumonia on CXR .
He was supported on BIPAP for his respiratory status .
An ABG was attempted in the Deanna however it was limited by pt discomfort .
ABG on arrival to the ICU was 7.29/56/75 .
He was continued on BIPAP .
Blood cultures and sputum cultures were sent .
Over the course of the day he continued to decline .
He was given some prn Morphine for comfort .
In the evening of the day of admission he was noted to be increasingly somnolent .
A repeat ABG was performed which was 7.03/129/148 .
His family was notified that he was doing worse and came in to visit him .
It was his family 's wish that he be made comfortable .
Based upon this wish the BIPAP was removed and he was placed on nasal cannula .
He was written for a morphine drip however he expired before this could be initiated .
Secondary issues
Elevated lactate :
This was concerning for early sepsis given RLL PNA .
His blood pressures remained elevated and he was hydrated with NS conservatively , given h/o CHF and dyspnea .
DM2 :
He was covered with a Insulin drip while unstable
CV :
CAD :
He was not taking any PO medications per Hunt Center Rehab so all medications were held .

Sigmoid diverticulosis with focal narrowing of the sigmoid colon just distal to the dilatation with wall thickening , due to diverticulitis .
This area can be a leading point of obstruction .
An underlying mass lesion or cancer cannot be excluded in this area , and further clinical investigation is recommended .
2. Limited evaluation for known sigmoid-vesicle fistula .
3. Small amount of ascites , somewhat increased anterior to the liver .

Due to atherosclerosis , assessment of the intraluminal process of these branches is limited .
CTA/CT abd 03-07 :
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism .
Small bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis .
2. Left lower quadrant thick-walled peripherally enhancing fluid collection , which appears to communicate with the sutured end of the proximal sigmoid colon via a small collection of extraluminal gas .
In the correct clincial setting , this could be consistent with an abscess .
3. Moderate intraabdominal ascites .
4. Status post ileostomy without evidence of small-bowel obstruction .
5. Distended gallbladder .
6. Diverticulosis within the right remnant sigmoid colon .

Service :
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71 - year-old gentleman who was admitted to the St. Anne 's Hospital as a transfer from the Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield .
Prior to admission , he had a long and complicated hospital course at the outside hospital .
His hospital course began on 2014-02-13 when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery .
His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation .
The hematoma formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit .
This emergent cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal tracheostomy .
During his subsequent hospital course , he had an additional CHF exacerbation .
He was medically managed and eventually his tracheostomy was decannulated .
However , just prior to admission to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation .
This necessitated emergent intubation .
With EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction , he was transferred to the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Diabetes type 2 treated with oral medication .
2. Cerebrovascular disease , status post left carotid endarterectomy in 2008 .
3. Status post right cerebrovascular accident in 2009 with residual left-sided weakness .
4. Status post right carotid endarterectomy on 2014-02-13 .
5. Fall from standing on 2014-01-29 with resultant displaced radial fracture which was reduced , closed , and casted .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
No history of catheterization prior to admission to the Saint Vincent Hospital .
8. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.7.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER THE Stillman Infirmary :
1. Lovenox 1 mg per kilogram subcutaneously b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Regular insulin sliding scale .
6. Captopril 6.25 mg q.i.d.
7. Lasix drip at 2 per hour .
8. Versed drip .
9. TPN .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
This is a gentleman who is intubated , comfortable , with minimal sedation .
He was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 .
His pulse was in the 70s , blood pressure 119/58 .
He was breathing 12 per minute and saturating 98% .
His CVP is ranging from 07-27 .
He was intubated and has a nasogastric tube .
His neck has a well-healed right carotid endarterectomy scar .
There is also a well-healing tracheostomy scar .
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart was regular with an S1 and S2 .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds .
The extremities were without edema .
The left arm was in a cast .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Knueppel was admitted to the CCU at the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary .
Upon admission , he was treated for his pneumonia .
He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2014-03-06 .
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery , 90% stenosis of the LAD , 80% stenosis of the circumflex , 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery .
After reviewing cardiac catheterization data , a consultation was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting .
Over the ensuing days , Mr. Nina CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia .
He was treated with a full course of Zosyn .
On 2014-03-11 , Mr. Knueppel went to the Operating Room with Dr. Streeter .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels .
He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and diagonal in a sequential fashion , saphenous vein graft to his PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM .
The procedure was performed by Dr. Streeter and assisted by Dr . .....................
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel had a long postoperative course .
His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically .
During his postoperative course , he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension .
At the time of discharge , he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction .
Mr. Knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation .
The status of Mr. Nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation .
After a very slow wean from ventilatory support , Mr. Knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine .
He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT .
For this reason , Mr. Knueppel was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close monitoring could be performed .
In addition , he had chest PT performed at very regular intervals by the ICU staff .
His pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization .
Mr. Knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital .
There is much scarring surrounding his larynx .
Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating .
As is expected , Mr. Knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his Boston Regional Medical Centerr hospital course .
The study was repeated and yet again Mr. Knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration .
After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube , Mr. Knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit .
This was performed on 2014-04-01 , postoperative day number 21 .
This procedure was performed by Dr. Kevin Taussig and assisted by Dr. Carla Solan .
The procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel Robertson a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital .
This injury had been reduced and casted at the outside institution .
Postoperatively , there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting .
His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome .
The cast was replaced by a plaster splint .
Mr. Knueppel should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon in the Worcester State Hospital for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint .
By postoperative day number 23 , Mr. Nina pulmonary status was deemed sufficiently stable .
His hypertension was well controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds .
At this point , he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft , four vessels .
2. Congestive heart failure .
3. Klebsiella pneumonia .
4. Failed swallow study status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement .
5. Central line culture positive for coagulase - negative Staphylococcus aureus , status post a 14 day treatment with vancomycin and removal of the line .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Methylphenidate 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Chester was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and underwent routine preoperative evaluation .
He remained pain free on medical therapy .
Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery .
On 04-18 , Dr. Oneill performed off pump coronary artery bypass grafting .
For surgical details , please see seperate dictated operative note .
Following the operation , he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring .
Within 24 hours , he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident .
Given hypotension and bradycardia , he was slow to wean from Neosynephrine .
Low dose beta blockade was eventually resumed .
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication .
On postoperative day three , he transferred to the SDU .
He maintained a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias .
He remained in sinus bradycardia ( rate 50-60 ) and tolerated low dose beta blockade .
On POD #6 his creatinine became slightly elevated at 1.4 , his lasix was discontinued and the following day his creatinine was stable at 1.4 .
He continued to progress and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 7 .
His discharge chest x-ray showed persistent bibasilar atelectasis with only tiny pleural effusions .
Of note , he will need to remain on Plavix for three months postop given the off pump procedure .
In addition , he will need to remain on Imdur given use of his right internal mammary artery as a "" free "" arterial graft in preventing 
vasospasm .

1. Congestive heart failure .
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy .
3. A 27 week intrauterine pregnancy .
4. Chronic hypertension .
5. Asthma .
6. History of atrioseptal defect .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 28 - year-old , gravida 3 , para 1 , at approximately 27 weeks gestation , who was admitted on 2014-05-12 due to increasing symptoms of congestive heart failure .
She has known dilated cardiomyopathy with a baseline ejection fraction of approximately 25% .
She had been managed as an outpatient during her pregnancy and was on multiple medications including Lasix 40 mg daily , Hydralazine 25 mg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily , digoxin 0.5 mg daily and Lovenox 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously .
She also took albuterol on a p.r.n. basis for her asthma .
She has known allergy to penicillin , vancomycin and erythromycin .
She was evaluated upon presentation by the Maternal Fetal Medicine attending on call as well as by Cardiology .
She was found to have symptoms of congestive heart failure as well as decreased fetal movement .
Fetal monitoring initially on admission was appropriate for gestational age .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical exam , she was noted to have bilateral lower extremity edema , mildly elevated pressures in the 140 to 150/90 range , and jugular venous distension .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After consultation with Cardiology as well as Anesthesia on call that evening , it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for intensive monitoring .
Central IV access was obtained .
The patient was carefully diuresed over the next 48 hours .
Symptoms of congestive heart failure gradually abated over the next 48 to 72 hours .
The patient was given antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity .
A Neonatology consultation was obtained during the course of the hospitalization .
After discussion , it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester .
The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on 2014-05-19 at approximately 28 weeks gestation .
The cesarean section was performed on the West Campus in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite .
This was performed in this location in case any acute cardiac decompensation occurred during the time of cesarean section .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was on standby during the surgery .
The patient went to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit on the West Campus postoperatively .
She did well during the postoperative period .
She required several episodes of diuresis due to increasing shortness of breath on postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 due to worsening symptoms of shortness of breath from fluid shifts that normally occur during the postpartum period .
The patient was transferred to the West Campus on postoperative day #2 in stable condition .
She did well during the remainder of her postoperative course and was continued on her medication regimen that she had been on during the antepartum period .
She was discharged to home on postoperative day #4 .
She was to followup with Maternal Fetal Medicine in 5 to 7 days .
She had followup with her primary cardiologist in Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital scheduled for 1 week postoperatively .
Of note , the patient also underwent tubal ligation at the time of cesarean section .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Toprol XL 100 mg daily , Hydralazine 25 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg twice a day , digoxin 0.75 mg daily , Lovenox 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously and albuterol p.r.n.

CT C - SPINE W/O CONTRAST ; CT RECONSTRUCTION
Reason : 72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATIONS : Fall down 20 stairs .
TECHNIQUE : Noncontrast cervical spine CT .
COMPARISON : None .
NOTE : This study was initially performed on 2014-10-21 .
Findings were discussed with Dr. Leanne Vazquez at the time this study was performed , but the study was not dictated until the morning of 2014-10-22 , due to PACS malfunction .
NONCONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE CT : There are minimally displaced and comminuted fractures through the left C7 and T1 transverse processes .
The margins do not appear to extend into the foramina transversaria .
Positioning limits assessment of alignment due to extreme head tilting to the right , but this is likely the best obtainable secondary to intubation and nasogastric tube placement .
Allowing for the limitations , the vertebral bodies are normal in height and normally aligned .
There is no atlantoaxial subluxation .
The lateral masses of C1 articulate normally about the odontoid process .
Prevertebral soft tissue swelling cannot be excluded secondary to intubation .
Extensive carotid arterial calcifications are present in the bulb regions bilaterally .
Biapical lung scarring and mild bronchiectasis are present .
Also noted is sclerosis and opacification of the visualized left mastoid air cells and mastoid tip , likely chronic inflammatory 
disease .
IMPRESSION : Minimally displaced , comminuted fractures of the left C7 and T1 transverse processes .
No evidence of extension into the foramina transversaria .

Reason : bleed ?
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
bleed ?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATION : Intraparenchymal hemorrhage after fall .
Assess for hemorrhage .
TECHNIQUE : Non-contrast head CT .
COMPARISON : No prior studies are available .
By report , the patient has an outside study .
Should this become available , an addendum will be issued to this report following the comparison with the outside examination .
NOTE : This study was initially performed on the morning of 10-21 , and is being dictated on the morning of 10-22 due to PACS malfunction .
Findings were called to Dr. Leanne Vazquez on the morning of 10-21 .
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT : There is a small amount of hemorrhage within the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles , right greater than left .
Located within the atrium of the right lateral ventricle is an 18 x 10 mm nodular area of increased density which is separate from the choroid plexus .
There is no evidence of surrounding edema .
There is diffuse brain atrophy and chronic microvascular infarction throughout the white matter .
There is a remote right frontal infarct .
There is no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction .
The ventricles do not appear dilated relative to the sulci , and there is no shift of normally midline structures .
There is no skull fracture .
There is opacification of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx but an NG tube is present , and the patient is intubated .
Opacified and sclerotic left mastoid air cells are noted .
IMPRESSION :
1. Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage .
2. Ovoid 18 - mm density within the atrium of the right lateral ventricle .
This could represent either an atypically located blood clot or an intraventricular mass , and further evaluation with contrast - enhanced MRI of the brain , when clinically feasible , is recommended .
Results were discussed with Dr. Leanne Vazquez in the early afternoon on 2014-10-21 .

TECHNIQUE : Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained .
Comparison is made to a previous study from 2014-10-27 .
FINDINGS :
There are numerous areas of decreased attenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , indicating chronic microvascular infarction .
There is also an old right frontal lobe cortical infarction .
A small right occipital lobe chronic infarction is also evident .
There is a small amount of blood layering in both lateral ventricles , and this has decreased since the previous study .
The size and shape of the ventricles is unchanged .
No new hemorrhage is observed .
There is opacification of the mastoid air cells , greater on the left than the right .
There is some fluid or mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses .

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Home .
PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN :
Dr. Shaw at Wellesley House .
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS :
1. Feedings at discharge - Similac 24 kilocalories per ounce p.o. ad lib .
If the patient achieves above adequate weight gain of 18-20 grams per kilogram per day , consider decreasing calories to standard 20 kilocalories per ounce .
2. Car seat positioning screening passed .
3. State newborn screening sent per protocol and no abnormal reports have been received .
4. Immunizations received :
Synagis RSV prophylaxis given today due to multiple siblings at home with daycare exposure and the patient being between 32 and 35 weeks .

Brief Hospital Course :
47 yo F w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia , SLE w/ h/o pericarditis , transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit , h/o ureteropelvic stone and urosepsis , and h/o RLE DVT admitted 11-29 w/ left pyelo and right 8 mm proximal ureteral stone w/ right hydro s/p perc urostomy tube to relieve right hydro .
.
## GNR sepsis:
Upon admission , pt was febrile to 101.2 with U/A consistent with UTI .
A CT abd showed 8mm obstructing stone , hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis .
Her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h/o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w/ hydro + pyelo by CT. The patient went to IR on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. Upon admission , she was treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin and Flagyl .
She was started on the MUST protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal SVO2 >70% .
She was hypoxic requiring 3L nasal cannula O2 .
She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP in the 70s .
She was transferred to the CMED where the patient was continued on the MUST protocol with goais of CVP 10-12 , SVO2 greater than 70% .
The patient was bolused with NS and did not required pressors .
On the day after admission to the CMED , the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2L NC .
Repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient 's mild hypoxia .
Given that the patient had been maintaining a MAP of 60 without fluids or pressors , her goal CVP was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload .
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending .
Ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again GNR .
Gent and Cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing GNR sensitive to Jacoby but resistant to both Gent and Cipro .
Additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement .
Blood cltures from 11-30 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and 12-01 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and PROTEUS MIRABILIS both sensitive to the Meropenam which she had already been receiving .
Urine cultures from 11-30 grew STAPH AUREUS COAG + , and GRAM NEGATIVE RODS of two morphologies ( not further speciated ) .
She defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge .
At the time of discharge , blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date .
She received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with Meropenam ( for a total of 3 weeks ) upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives .
.
## Right hydronephrosis :
Given right sided hydronephrosis and GNR bactermeia , a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR 2014-11-30 .
The patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement , 950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube .
The tube appeared to be functioning well , draining urine with occasional clot passage .
Urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations .
Cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100K GNR , possibly of two colony morphologies , speciation and sensitivity pending .
.
## Hct drop :
On admission to hospital patient had Hct of 29.2 .
In the setting of Right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting Hct , concerning for bleed , with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 .
A CT abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed .
Hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge .
This can be followed as an outpatient .
Anemia workup revealed a picture of anemia of chronic disease ( TIBC 225 , B12 and Folate normal , Hapto 397 , Ferritin 51 , TRF 173 , Iron 35 ) .
.
## Hypoxia:
The patient on admission was requiring 3 L NC in the setting of receiving 2L NS and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion .
The patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with O2 sats 97-98% on room air .
As her BP remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a MAP < 60 or CVP < 8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status .
Patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an EF of 60-65% .
her O2 requirement by discharge was 96% on room air with no SOB .
.
## Steroid-induced hyperglycemia :
At home , the patient received metformin and SSI .
The patient 's metformin was held and she has been maintained on SSI qid while in the CMED .
As the patient appeared to be clinically stable , her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of Prednisone 40mg PO qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars .
Her Metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156 , respectively .
.
## Hypothyroidism :
Repeat TSH and Free T4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. Patient was continued on Levothyroxine 75mcg po qd .
.
## H/o transverse myelitis/optic neuritis :
On stress dose steroids originally given MUST protocol and sepsis , as patient clinically stabilized , she was changed back to home dose of Prednisone 40mg pO qd .
.
## SLE :
Currently no sx of active disease .
No manifestations of SLE during this admission .
.
# Osteoporosis - We continued actonel/vit D , Tums
.
## Capsular ossification :
We continued CMED CSRU gtt .
.
## FEN:
She had a low bicarb likely due to renal wasting but there is an anion gap present .
Serum acetone was normal .
We followed lactate while she was in the CMED which was normal .
She was NPO periodically but maintained a normal diet prior to discharge .
.

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness , who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms .
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .
However , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .
However , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .
A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .
However , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .
Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.
Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .
She was treated with a fluid bolus .
The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .
She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .
She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .
She denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .
A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .
An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .
Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .
It was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .
On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .
Her stress test was cancelled .
A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .
A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .
There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's Grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .
In addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .
It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .
It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .
A right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .
A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .
In addition , a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .
Therefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .
Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram .
Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram .
Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .
Therefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .
Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .
Therefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .
Plans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .
However , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .
Upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .
She described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .
The patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.
Review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .
The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .
Given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy .
On 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration .
During the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .
She had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .
In addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .
The patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .
This was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .
Because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy .
Flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
The patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .
Over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose .
The patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .
A high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .
Plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .
However , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site .
Surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .
A surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .
In addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .
Following this episode the patient felt like she was "" too stressed "" for pacemaker placement .
Therefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .
Over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .
She continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .
However , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .
On 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .
She had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .
The patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement .
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her Flolan therapy well .
She had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home .
She was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan therapy .
Following pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission .
However , she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
However , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed .
A urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .
Therefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a 10 - day course .
Following initiation of the antibiotic the patient 's white blood cell count quickly came down , and she remained afebrile .
At the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature .
She will complete two more days of Levaquin therapy as an outpatient .
3. RENAL :
The patient 's BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .
These remained stable and within normal limits .
It was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence , and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
4. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
She was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .
5. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient 's hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
Despite bleeding from the Hickman site , she did not require any transfusion therapy .
6. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits , being replaced as needed .
She was discharged to home on a regular diet .
7. ENDOCRINE :
The patient with a history of hypothyroidism .
She was continued on her regular Synthroid dose .
She will need a TSH and T4 checked as an outpatient .
8. CODE STATUS :
The patient is a full code .
9. FLOLAN ADMINISTRATION :
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a 6 - minute walk test .
On room air , the patient 's oxygen saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .
The patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies .
She was to follow up with Dr. Savage in the Clinic the following week .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
The patient was stable .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
She was discharged to home .
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :

2015-01-19 04:47 AM BLOOD ALT - 355 * AST - 90 * AlkPhos - 352 * TotBili - 3.2 *
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Reese Jones the procedure well .
Post-operatively , he was slow to recover but did progressed nicely .
Within the fist few days after the surgery , his liver function tests were elevated to as high as 1484 for ALT , 915 for AST , and 7.6 for total bilirubin .
His Alk Phos were inititially low a few days after the operation , but it rised up to 422 two weeks after , but down-trended , as with the rest of his liver function test by the time he left the hospital .
Several tests , including Duplex Ultrasound , CT of the Abdomen , and Abdominal A-gram all showed patent right and left hepatic arteries arising from the celiac trunk .
An ERCP was also done , showing a filling defect from a narrowed donor duct , but no strictures .
A sphincterotomy wss done to drain the sludge from the central common duct .
There was a small bleed resulting from the sphincterotomy , but it was controlled by epinepherine injections .
Initial biopsy of the allograft three days after the operation was consistent with preservation / ischemic injury .
Result of a second biopsy , which was done three weeks after the operation , is still pending .
During his hospital stay , his blood glucose were elevated and labile ranging from below normal values [ 40-60 's] to the 200-300 's .
He was completely assymptomatic while below normal values .
At one point , he had to be on an insulin drip .
However with the help of Albano , his blood glucose began to normalize .
He has also been working with Physical Therapy to regain his strength .
He has been ambulating on his own several times a day .
Also , he has been afebrile with stable vitals , tolerating a regular diet , producing good urine and adequate stool .
Furthermore , he has had no complaints , including pain , while his lab values are normalizing .
He will be discharged to home , in good condition , with very specific intructions to follow up with Albano for his diabetic care and the Transplant Clinic for his transplant care .

Chief Complaint :
Increasing abdominal girth
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
4u FFP
Paracentesis
History of Present Illness :
47 female with h/o HCV cirrhosis compocated by encephalopathy , ascites , and h/o portal vein thrombosis ( right anterior portal vein ) and portalcaval shunt ( reversed flow in main portal vein ) presents from liver clinic with increasing abdominal girth .
She also described sob , nausea , worsening lower ext edema .
She denied abd pain , fevers , chills .
She was admitted for a large volume paracentesis but her INR on admission was 3.8 .
She received 4units of FFP which decreased her INR to 2.2 and then 2 more units during the tap .
She then had 6L of non-bloody ascitic fluid removed without complication .
She received 36gm of albumin following the tap .
Her BP on admission was 120/70 and remained stable following the tap .
Over the next several hours , pt complained of abd pain but this resolved on its own without medication .
In the am , she was found to have a hct of 24 , down from 32 and plts 35 , down from 72 .
She received 2 units of plts and 1 unit of PRBC s.
Her BP was then noted to be decreased at 80/40 which improved mildly to 90/30 with 1.5L of NS .
Temp noted to be low at 94 and she was placed on bear hugger which improved temp to 96.7 .
Her mental status also had decreased from admission and her urine output was minimal , 225cc over the past 12 hours .
Creatinine this am was 1.9 from 0.9 yesterday .
Previous hospital course ( per H&P ):
She was recently hospitalised from 02-23 / 03-04 for abdominal discomfort at which time she underwent paracentesis that ruled out SBP and relieved her abdominal pain .
She also underwent US that revealed patent portal and hepatic vessels .
While her discharge summary maintains that she was continued on Furosemide / Spirinolactone / Propranolol , the patient did not receive any scripts on discharge and as a result did not take these medications .
Also , due to worsening renal function , she was started on octreotide / midodrine / albumin for hepatorenal 
syndrome ( Cr 3.3 at its worst ) which resolved prior to her discharge .
The hospitalisation was also significant for mild DIC for which she received cryoglobulins and UTI (+ Enterococcus and + Klebsiella ).
She received a 7 day course of amoxicillin for which Enterococcus was sensitive but Klebsiella unknown .

RADIOLOGY
1. Small cirrhotic liver with what appears to be a portocaval shunt .
2. Moderate ascites .
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis .
4. No hydronephrosis .
5. Borderline splenomegaly .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P : 48 yo morbidly obese woman with HCV cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy , esophageal varices and partial vein thrombosis ( but no hx of SBP ) presents with increasing abdominal girth likely secondary to ascites .
Admitted for diagnostic / therapeutic paracentesis and then transferred to the ICU for hypotension , confusion and anemia .
# Liver cirrhosis : MELD score of 34 on admission .
Pt became more encephalopathic during her hospital course .
She was not a transplant candidate due to her obesity .
A family meeting was held on hospital day #4 which included the pt 's closest family members , her hepatologist , Dr. Steidl , her PCP , Dr. Popoff and the ICU team .
After it was explained that the pt 's prognosis was very poor given that she was not a transplant candidate , the 
decision was made by the family and the medical team to withdraw care .
The pt was made comfortable and she expired several hours later .
# Recurrent ascites : On the medical floor , pt had a large volume paracentesis ( 6 liters ) followed by replacement with albumin .
She had no evidence of SBP .
# Hypotension : Pt became hypotensive following the large volume paracentesis despite replacement with albumin .
This was thought to be 04-09 the large volume tap verses sepsis though she had no other evidence of sepsis .
She was placed on pressors to maintain a MAP > 55 .
Once the decision was made to withdraw care , the pressors were discontinued .
# Anemia : Hct dropped following the tap and there was concern for bleed into her abdomen .
She received one unit of PRBC s.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of bleed .
Her hematocrit remained stable at 24-26 following the acute drop.
# ARF : Creatinine has increased from 0.9 on admission to 1.9 on admission to ICU .
Urine lytes with Na of 10 indicating either pre-renal or hepatorenal .
Fluid challenge with 36gm of albumin , one unit of PRBCs and 2L of NS .
Will check creatinine this afternoon .
Pt previously diagnosed with hepatorenal and was started on midodrine , octreotide and albumin ; these were 
continued .
Her creatinine continued to increase , likely due to her worsening liver failure .
Pt expired during this admission after family discussion to make her comfort care only .

First degree AV block with PR interval 220 , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block , 0.1103 N. Fifth Cir. depressions in
V4 through V6 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath - Though the patient denied shortness of breath on admission , a progress note from
Norwood nursing facility suggested that the patient had been having shortness of breath and cough for approximately one day with difficulty ambulating , needing to travel in a wheelchair .
The patient was afebrile on admission with a normal white blood cell count but had significant wheezing and rales on physical examination with a possible left lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray .
The etiology of the patient 's shortness of breath was considered a likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers .
The patient was also started on Doxycycline given the concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray .
She was also continued on steroids given evidence of severe airway obstruction .
The patient 's shortness of breath was also considered possibly related to a coronary event and she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient 's enzymes were cycled and were negative .
The patient 's electrocardiogram performed on hospital day number two was concerning for 2:1 heart block and the cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit late on hospital day number two and received a temporary wire .
The following day the patient received a permanent dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker .
The patient was transferred back to the general medicine service where she continued to exhibit signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and nebulizers , steroids and antibiotics were continued .
The patient 's respiratory status improved throughout the remainder of her hospitalization and oxygen was eventually weaned .
Once the patient was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit , she appeared to have an element of heart failure in addition to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with impressive urine output and improvement in her overall fluid status .
The patient was eventually restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix once her renal function improved to baseline and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization .
Heart block - As noted previously , the patient 's electrocardiogram was significant for a 2:1 heart block and cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient received a temporary pacing wire on the evening of hospital day number two and on hospital day number three received a dual chamber pacemaker .
Renal - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8 , considered likely secondary to hypovolemia .
Her calculated fractional excretion of sodium was 0.13 percent suggesting a prerenal cause .
The patient 's creatinine improved to 1.1 with hydration .
Once the patient 's creatinine had improved to baseline , her Lasix and ace inhibitor were restarted and the patient 's creatinine was noted to be stable .
Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with a history of gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac positive stools on admission .
Her hematocrit was noted to trend down after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and her history of gastrointestinal bleed in addition to use of steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , the gastroenterology consult service was contacted .
The results of that consultation and potential esophagogastroduodenoscopy are pending at the time of dictation .
Hypertension - The patient had moderate control of her blood pressure throughout her admission .
Her calcium channel blocker and ace inhibitor were continued .
Hematology - As noted previously , the patient 's hematocrit was noted to drop after transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and the patient 's history of gastrointestinal bleed , gastroenterology consult service was contacted for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy .
The results of this consultation are pending at the time of dictation .
The remainder of the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course , discharge diagnoses , medications and follow-up will be dictated at the time of discharge .

Extremities : There was no edema in the extremities .
The dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA : On admission , white count 10.8 , hematocrit 38.2 , platelets 324,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE : The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where she was found to have two vessel disease .
The proximal LAD was found to have a 90% lesion with a septal branch with a 95% stenosis and a diagonal branch with 99% stenosis .
The patient had twin LAD stents to the LAD diagonal and LAD septal branches with Taxus stents .
This restored flow appropriately .
The patient also had proximal RCA lesion of 80% and a mid RCA lesion of 80-90% which were not intervened upon .
The patient was given an aspirin and Plavix and in addition started on a beta Elmore , Maxine ACE inhibitor , and these were titrated up as her blood pressure tolerated .
Given the fact that the patient had issues with muscle cramping with Atorvastatin in the past , she was started on Pravastatin which should give less of these side effects .
The patient will follow-up with Cardiology in one months time for further management of her coronary artery disease and further evaluation of her remaining RCA lesions .
2. PUMP : The patient had an echocardiogram to assess her LV function .
She was found to have an ejection fraction of 30-35% as well as an akinetic apex and apical mid and septal akinesis .
Given the fact that the patient had significant apical akinesis , she was started on heparin with a transition to Coumadin for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the setting of apical akinesis .
On discharge , the patient was given Lovenox injections which should be continued until the patient reaches a therapeutic dose of Coumadin .
3. RHYTHM : The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization with no significant events .
The patient had an EP evaluation and will be followed-up by Dr. Welch .
14-087 , the patient had a signal-averaged EKG .
She will follow-up with Dr. Welch with an echocardiogram on 2015-07-24 in a meeting to discuss risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and possible ICD placement .
4. NEUROLOGY : The patient complained of left lower extremity weakness with ambulation two days after her cardiac catheterization .
The patient had no evidence for weakness on examination with good proximal and distal strength in the lower extremities as well as intact sensation .
The patient worked with Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate without difficulty .
She was also able to ascend stairs without difficulty .
The patient was already on an aspirin and Plavix should this represent a small stroke .
However , there was no evidence for neurologic deficit on examination and this will be followed-up by her primary care physician .
5. HEMATOLOGY : The patient was discharged on Coumadin for apical akinesis and stroke risk .
This will be further monitored by her primary care physician , Dr. Banks , who will adjust her Coumadin dose .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE : Stable .
DISCHARGE STATUS : To home .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : ST elevation myocardial infarction , status post left anterior descending artery stent .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Lisinopril 5 q.d.
3. Toprol XL 100 q.d.
4. Coumadin 5 q.d.
5. Plavix 75 q.d.
6. Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. until therapeutic on Coumadin .
7. Pravastatin 80 q.d.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS : The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician in the week following discharge for further monitoring of her INR and adjustment of her Coumadin dose .
The patient will also follow-up with Electrophysiology with Dr. Welch on 2015-07-24 .
In addition to this , the patient will follow-up with Cardiology , Dr. Foster , and Dr. Upshaw , on 2015-07-06 for further monitoring .

Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment :
68M with multiple vascular risk factors presents with acute onset right-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria , aphasia concerning for acute left MCA infarct .
Patient arrived in Daniel within 3 hours of symptom onset and head CT showed no evidence of bleed .
However , as wife had not seen patient before he became symptomatic , there was some concern that he had symptoms earlier than 6 am , and therefore would be outside the 3 hour window for TPA .
MRI was performed which showed diffusion abnormalities but no hyperintensity on T2 / FLAIR imaging supporting the acute onset .
Therefore , IV tpa thrombolytics were administered within 3 hours of symptom onset .
Within minutes the patient showed decreased right sided weakness and improved from a global aphasia to an anterior aphasia picture .
Given the likely embolic etiology of infarct , carotid doppler and TTE were performed .
Doppler revealed no hemodynamically significant lesions bilaterally .
Echo did not reveal potential source of emboli , but showed striking left ventricle akinesis and hypokinesis presumbly due to past MI x 2 .
Given that the stroke occurred while taking aspirin and plavix , and given the severe akinesis of the left ventricle , we decided to initiate anticoagulation with warfarin to help prevent future strokes .
Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with heparin and coumadin beginning on the evening of 2016-08-23 .
The patient and his wife , a nurse , were educated on low molecular wt heparin , which was started in the hospital on 2015-08-26 with close follow-up scheduled with Dr. Demmert of the Wareham VA primary care clinic the next morning .
His depakote was continued for his bipolar disorder .
On discharge , strength was nearly intact in the limbs , though he still had a right-sided facial droop .
Additionally , he still had mild dysarthria and mild anterior aphasia .
Additionally , risk factor modification was continued .
Lipid panel was checked and showed good control of lipids on his home dose of zocor .
Patient has no history of diabetes , and fasting glucose was 78 , but A1C was slightly elevated at 5.9 .
He may need further glucose monitoring in the future .
His home hypertensive medications were held while in the hospital to help increase cerebral perfusion and prevent further ischemia .
They will be restarted on discharge .
Speech therapy was also consulted , and recommended oupatient speech therapy .
Similarly , outpatient PT was recommended for his gait difficulties from his previous strokes .
Residual deficits include right side facial droop from previous stroke and moderately severe dysarthria and anterior aphasia with word finding difficulties .

Service :
CARDIOTHOR
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mitral valve repair .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old Czech speaking gentleman with a history of severe mitral regurgitation .
For the past several years , the patient has continued to have significant exercise intolerance which has limited his ability to work .
He reports severe dyspnea on exertion .
The patient had a recent admission earlier in the month and he was discharged on 2015-09-10 , after undergoing cardiac catheterization .
This was significant for demonstrating no flow-limited disease in the coronaries but several fistulae
from the left anterior descending to the PA .
Several of these were coil embolized during this admission .
He tolerated this well , was sent home , and now returns for his mitral valve repair .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Mitral valve regurgitation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
None .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day .
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day .
3. Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is currently on Disability and lives at home with his wife .
Kimberly was born in Great Britain .
He denies any ETOH or tobacco use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is in no acute distress .
Temperature is 98.3 F. ; pulse is 76 ; blood pressure 113/52 ; breathing 18 ; 98% on room air .
HEENT :
The patient is missing many teeth .
Oropharynx is clear .
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy .
Supple neck .
Heart is regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur .
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdomen is soft and nontender .
The patient has no cyanosis , clubbing or edema in extremities .
LABORATORY :
On admission include a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit of 32.5 , platelets of 202 .
Sodium of 140 , potassium of 3.5 , BUN of 4 , creatinine of 0.6 , glucose of 137 .
Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate or pneumothorax .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrates no significant disease in the coronary arteries .
Two branches of an left anterior descending to PA fistula which was successfully coiled .
There is a persistent flow through an inferior branch of the left anterior descending to PA fistula and a persistent branch of the circumflex to PA branch fistula which anatomically were not suitable for coil embolization .
Ejection fraction was 60% .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On the day of admission , the patient went to the Operating Room and underwent a minimally invasive
mitral valve repair .
He tolerated this procedure well .
The patient was brought to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on minimal pressor support .
He was successfully weaned off this support .
The patient was fully weaned from ventilatory support secondary to a persistent acidemia .
This was treated with sodium bicarbonate and a Swan-Ganz was placed to provide close hemodynamic monitoring .
The patient was found to have stable hemodynamics with appropriate mixed venous saturations in the 70% range .
The patient was corrected to a normal pH of 7.41 by the first postoperative night and remained stable .
He was then weaned off of ventilatory support and was successfully extubated .
The patient did have a slight bit of confusion early in post-extubation course which cleared .
This was also compounded by a language barrier since the patient cannot speak English .
In addition , the patient 's early postoperative course had a tremendous urine output .
It was equally up to 700 cc. an hour and a renal consultation was obtained .
He underwent a head CT scan to rule out intracranial pathology leading to diabetes insipidus .
This was negative .
The patient 's serum and urine electrolytes indicated that this diuresis was appropriate .
The patient 's urine output has decreased and his BUN and creatinine remained normal .
The patient 's Foley was discontinued .
He had developed some hematuria which has resolved .
The patient has remained stable and is now ready for discharge to home with follow-up in approximately four weeks .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Mitral regurgitation status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice a day .
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day .
3. Percocet one to two p.o. q. four hours p.r.n.
4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DIGibsonE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. The patient will follow-up with Dr. de las Grau in four weeks .
2. He will follow-up with his primary care physician , Dr. Blake , in two weeks .
3. The patient will call for any fevers or difficulties with the wound care , and will be instructed with an interpreter present .

Chief Complaint :
transfer from OSH , seizure
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Lumbar puncture
History of Present Illness :
Ms. Swanson is a 53 yo woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder , brain injury , and ? atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking .
History is obtained from her sister , William from Lawrence General Hospital , and from her primary neurologist , Dr. Brian .
She lives in an assisted living , and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90 minutes .
EMS gave her valium 5 mg pr at the facility and brought her to Barnstable County Hospital .
She persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium 10 mg and ativan 1 mg , as well as loaded with dilantin 1000 mg .
She was transferred to the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital CMED .
Here she was given an additional valium 5 mg x 2 and ativan 1 mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and right hand .
Since the ativan , her facial twitching has apparently improved , but she continues to have hand twitches .
She also had an EEG , which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read .
Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder , possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury ( though per Dr. Paula , 
records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury ) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra .
Since she has seen Dr. Ollie , she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure , as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity .
Her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control .
He tried adding lamictal , but this caused a rash .
At the time of her last visit ( 2015-03-18 ) Dr. Bradley had discussed the addition of a third Castelluccio , possibly zonegran ( less likely topamax ), to the dilantin 200 mg bid and keppra 1500 mg bid .
Her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that .
However , she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit , with 15.4 in 05 - 23.5 in Theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .
Her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in Theresa , and a review of her Union Hospital - North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .
According to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .
She has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .
The patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .
Ms. Swanson also carries a diagnosis of "" atypical MS "", which she brought with her to Dr. Billie .
According to Dr. Nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .
She had an MRI in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .
She is not undergoing any treatment .
Reportedly she has been evaluated at Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children , HealthSouth Braintree Rehab Hospital , and possibly St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston .
She has not had an LP as far as Dr. Ginger knows .

Reactive lymphoid cells .
immunotyping negative .
CXR 09-28 : No evidence for pneumonia .
No change since prior study of 2015-09-24 .
CT HEAD FINDINGS : There is moderately severe , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity surrounding the frontal horns , posterior horns , and more superiorly , involving the centra semiovale .
These findings are unchanged from prior studies , and may relate to the "" atypical "" demyelinating process , suggested in the indication on the prior MRI ; however , they are non-specific .
There is no evidence of acute intra - or extra - axial hemorrhage .
There is no shift of normally midline structures .
The ventricles are mildly prominent , but are unchanged from the prior study .
There is no interval loss of focal gray - white matter differentiation to suggest acute infarction , though CT is not sensitive in the early stages .
No focal masses is seen .
IMPRESSION :
1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect ; no significant interval change from CT of 2015-07-20 .
2) Diffuse , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity , which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process ( as suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI ).
The markedly low - attenation ( 14-15 HU ) centered within this process suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation ("" black hole ""), or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis .
Generalized and marked callosal atrophy ( on the MR ) also suggest advanced , irreversible disease .
3) No mass is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study ; if clinically concerned , an MRI with gadolinium is recommended .
MRI : There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , suggesting demyelinating disease .
As previously noted , there is associated volume loss , thinning of the corpus callosum , and slight widening of the ventricles .
On post-contrast images , there is a probably stable appearance of a 5 mm linear , focal area of enhancement in the left centrum semiovale , of uncertain etiology .
Also ehancing is 3 mm linear lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly , not seen on the 08-20 MR , but that study was very motion - degraded .
The hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by multiple sclerosis .
There is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect .
No changes in the overall morphology of the brain are identified .
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .
The major vascular flow patterns are normal .
IMPRESSION :
1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter , consistent with severe demyelinating disease .
2. Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex .
This former lesion was evident on MR dating back to 2014-08-15 , though is more prominent at this time , likely due to less motion degradation of the current scan .
Etiology of these enhancing lesions is uncertain , but could be atypical manifestations of demyelination .
EEG :
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing .
Facial twitching was described by the technologist and seen on the video .
This is primarily right-sided , facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU .
There were no clear EEG correlate .
ABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side , and there were additional bursts of delta slowing  seen broadly on the left side alone .
ABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm .
They appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the right at times , though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for 
much of the recording .
It was of much lower voltage on the left .
HYPERVENTILATION : Could not be performed .
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION : Could not be performed .
SLEEP : No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen .
CARDIAC MONITOR : Showed a generally regular rhythm .
IMPRESSION : Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage dimunition , along with some slowing of the background .
The generalized and background features indicate a wide-spread encephalopathy .
The left sided slowing and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side , possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction .
There is a possibility of a structural lesion on the left , but the encephalopathy dominated the overall picture .
There were no clear epileptiform discharges .
No EEG correlate was established for the facial twitching .
The lack of EEG correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central cause ( and , indeed , this appeared most likely based on the clinical and video observations ).
Brief Hospital Course :
53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .
This is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .
In the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .
It is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .
Other possibilities include infection , including her UTI .
It is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .
Her seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .
Discussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .
Cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .
Topamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .
She was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .
She was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .
Ativan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).
MRI/MRA showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .
She will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation .
LP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).
Oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .
She will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .
Pending tests :
ANGIOTENSIN 1 CONVERTING ENZYME
EBV-PCR
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PCR
Ernest VIRUS ( JCV ) DNA PCR
LYME , TOTAL EIA WITH REFLEX TO CSF RATIO
VARICELLA DNA ( PCR )
VDRL
2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center ); no current role for MS medications .
MRI was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .
She also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the centrum semiovale .
LP was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .
Immunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).
Unfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the CSF ( lab sent CSF for other studies and there was not enough left over for OCB s).
This was relayed to the family ( Kirk ).
Given that she does have new lesions on MRI , if OCB s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS , and it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy .
This was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with Dr. Ford ( MS Hoyos ).
The family is confident in any decision Dr. Ford would make re : therapy for her MS .
3. fevers on admission : Pt w/ positive U/A , treated with bactrim x 3 days with defervescence .
4. depression : continue escitalopram ; assess need to change medication as an outpatient .
5. FEN : NGT was placed given her altered mental status , and she has been unable to pass a swallow evaluation , but has improved .
This should be repeated in several days as her mental status continues to clear .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Change in mental status .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 57-year-old nursing home resident female , who had been in her usual state of
health until about three weeks ago when the daughter noted she was sleeping more .
Per record , she has had multiple episodes in the last week of changes in mental status .
EMTs called many times .
The patient would awake prior to arrival and not need transfer .
The patient was seen at the Leonard Morse/Metrowest Medical Center on 09-28 .
No localizing etiology of delta MS .
That evening she was unresponsive and the patient was brought to Amesbury Hospital Hospital .
There her oxygen she was sating 65% on room air , increased to 98% with a nonrebreather mask .
There an ABG was done which showed an ABG of 7.42 , 62 , and 55 .
She had a head CT that was negative .
Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
Lumbar puncture was performed and the micro cultures are still pending .
She was seen by Psychiatry at the outside hospital , but noted there was no psychoses , but delirium .
The patient 's mental status waxed and waned there .
She also had a K of 6.0 and given 30 of Kayexalate , 5 of Haldol , 2 mg of Ativan given for
agitation , and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP was done prior .
Patient was transferred to the Kindred Hospital Melendez the patient 's primary care provider was here .
She is currently being seen by Addison Gilbert Hospital Group .
On arrival to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary , she was unresponsive with an oxygen saturation of 72% on 6 liters .
She was placed on 50% vent mask , which improved her oxygenation to 97% .
Patient was placed on BiPAP .
Original ABG here before BiPAP was 7.19 , 102 , and 92 .
After being placed on BiPAP , her blood pressure decreased to the 80s .
She responded to 1 liter of IV fluids , normal saline and blood pressure remained stable .
Patient had peripheral IV x1 placed and right femoral line placed in the Matthew .
When laying flat , her sats decreased to 50% on 30% FIO2 , PEEP of 10 , and pressure support of 5 .
Her ABG at the time was 7.24 , 91 , and 38 .
Once the patient sat up , her sats improved and her airway was no longer obstructed .
After a history on BiPAP about a half an hour , her ABG was 7.29 , 79 , and 106 on 30% pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 10 .
Patient was intermittently awaking .
She denied any pain and was not answering questions at the time .

This is in comparison to 2015-09-27 EKG .
Chest x-ray rotated low lung volumes , hazy opacities at bases .
Echocardiogram in 2010 :
Mild-to-moderate MR , TR .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues :
The patient presented with changes in mental status , pCO2 of 100 , pH of 7.19 , decreasing sats on arrival likely element of obstructive-sleep apnea .
She was monitored overnight .
She had admitted to the CMED and had multiple episodes of apnea throughout the night .
She was placed on pressure support , which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia .
Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of her respiratory acidosis .
Patient was eventually placed on BiPAP on hospital day three , on the date prior to discharge of BiPAP settings of 12/8/5 liters of oxygen with saturations of 96% with a gas of 7.38 , 67 , and 91 with an aim of a goal pCO2 of 67 .
She only had one episode of apnea on the day prior to discharge .
2. Delta MS/mental status issues :
Most likely her waxing and waning mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and UTI .
With improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her UTI and pneumonia , her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and waning .
Her daughters came by and visited her , and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge .
B12 , folate , RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS .
We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital , but on hospital day two .
Those cultures are still pending at the time .
Patient was also given multivites .
3. Fever issues :
The patient initially presented with T max of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell counts and a positive urinalysis .
A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI .
Upon calling the outside hospital , the urine was growing out Klebsiella , and patient was given a 10 day course of levofloxacin to cover both the pneumonia and UTI .
Blood cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this hospital visit and the CSF fluid from Whitter Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be further evaluated .
Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a decreasing white count x48 hours .
4. Acute renal failure issues :
Creatinine initially presented at 1.3 .
Patient is known to have a baseline of 1.0 , most likely hypovolemia and prerenal .
A FENa was sent , was 0.3% .
Patient was gently hydrated and IV fluids started up on a p.o. diet regimen .
On hospital day two , her creatinine returned to 0.8 , and she remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Patient's K was followed , and trended back down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9 .
5. Elevated transaminases :
Patient had no right upper quadrant pain .
Stewart sign was negative .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms .
There is no need to followup these transaminases .
6. Congestive heart failure history :
Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray .
Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation .
Patient was restarted on her beta blocker and .......- receptor blocker on hospital day two given that her creatinine had stabilized .
Patient had no further cardiac issues at this time .
She was on telemetry without any episodes of any rhythm abnormalities .
7. CMED CCU :
The patient had some vaginal bleeding x2 days .
Patient had a history of fibroids during this hospitalization .
Followed her examination .
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout this course .
Patient is strongly encouraged to followup with her outside primary care provider to followup for the vaginal bleeding given her history of fibroids and question metaplasia of the endometrium .
8. Heme :
Her hematocrit remained stable .
She had a history of nucleated RBCs likely secondary to stress and hypoxia during this admission .
Hemolysis laboratories were negative .
Patient was restarted on her iron supplementation .
Reticulocyte count was performed that was negative .
9. FEN :
She was NPO with a decrease in her mental status .
We slowly advanced her diet as her mental status improved and repleted her electrolytes , and started on her p.o. medications on hospital day two .
10. Diabetes :
Patient had q.i.d. fingersticks with a Humalog sliding scale and NPH doses were cut in half while she was NPO , and they were brought back to her normal doses on the day of discharge with a full diet .
11. Code status :
Full .
Two daughters came by and requested to be health care proxies as patient approved .
Documentation is in her medical chart .
12. Prophylaxis :
The patient was on subQ Heparin for DVT and ranitidine for GI prophylaxis .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged today to Lahey Clinic - North Shore Hospital for long-term pulmonary ........ therapy and further evaluation of her obstructive-sleep apnea .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Patient was stable with complete clearance of her mental status , advancement of her diet ,
blood pressure , and heart rate remained stable , and her oxygen saturations were well above 90% during the daytime on 2 liters nasal cannula and at night on the BiPAP settings
described above .
Physical Therapy consult is pending today .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. NPH 70 units q.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m.
2. Humalog sliding scale .
3. SubQ Heparin 5,000 units t.i.d.
4. Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Multivitamin x1 .
6. Losartan 25 mg p.o. q.d.

90 year-old woman with h/o of HTN p/w substernal chest pain shortly after exercise at nursing home , with EKG showing ST depressions in V1-V4 and troponin 0.07.
Likely NSTEMI .
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
.
* CV :
The patient 's family refused coronary artery catheterization .
The patient was given ASA , Plavix , heparin drip x 24 hours , nitro drip , atorvastatin , metoprolol , and lisinopril .
Her chest pain was controlled with morphine .
Her SBP remained in the 160s-170s on hospital day 1 and she was gently diuresed .
On hospital day 2 she experienced atrial fibrillation with HR in the 140s .
Her metoprolol dose was increased from 25 mg PO bid to 50 mg PO bid then 75 mg PO tid .
Her HR decreased to 70s-80s .
Her BP remained stable .
An ECHO showed that she had preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities .
We decided given her age that she would not be a good candidate for cardioversion for her afib nor would she be a good candidate for coumadin .
Therefore we will continue rate control with metoprolol this can be titrated if needed , and aspirin and plavix for anti-coagulation .
She should also continue on lipitor and lisinopril .
She should have her chem 7 checked next week given the start of her new meds .
Will also need LFT 's checked in 3-6 months .

Brief Hospital Course :
Ms. Bridge was admitted from OSH for coronary artery bypass surgery .
She underwent usual pre-operative testing along with carotid ultrasound .
CNIS revealed carotid stenosis and she ultimately underwent left carotid stenting by vascular surgery on 10-30 .
Please see report for details .
On 11-02 she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 .
Please see operative report for surgical details .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition .

On post-op day one chest tubes were removed and beta blockers and diuretics were initiated .
She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight .
Also on this day she was transferred to the SDU .
Early on post-op day two Ms. Bridge had an episode of aphasia .
She underwent an immediate head CT and Neuro consult and was transferred back to the CSRU .
CT was negative and she returned to baseline neuro status without deficits by arrival to CSRU .
Neurology concluded episode was most concerning for TIA .
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day four .
After remaining stable in the CSRU for several days without change in neuro status she was transferred back to the SDU on post-op day four .
She was then started on Heparin with transition to Coumadin ( goal INR of 2-3 secondary to h/o bilateral DVT 's).
During entire post-op course she was followed by physical therapy for strength and mobility .
She continued to improve steadily over the next several days without any other post-op 
complications .

Pulmonary clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Abdomen soft , mildly distended , nontender , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities with no edema , one to two pulses in all four extremities .
LABORATORY :

CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage or edema .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with normal intervals and ST wave inversions and early R wave progression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed .
1. Gastrointestinal bleed :
The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn .
As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells , the patient became tachycardic and short of breath .
His temperature raised from 98.6 F. , to 101.0 F.
He was shown to have rigors .
The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine , 100 mg of hydrocortisone , 25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid .
He had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material .
The patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask .
His saturations improved quickly on 100% non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes .
Shortly after his mental status changed ; he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours .
After that period of time , his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0 , which remained stable for the duration of his stay .
On admission , the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis .
On Wednesday , 11-25 , an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings :
Medium hiatal hernia , Barrett's esophagus , erosion of the gastroesophageal junction , granularity , erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis .
Erosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region , granularity , erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis .
It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding .
2. Cardiovascular :
During transfusion reaction episode , the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from 134 to 158 , for one to two hours .
EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia ; however , serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at 1075 , MB peaking at 114 and MB index peaking at 10.8 , consistent with myocardial damage .
The day following this episode , EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
The patient 's blood pressures remained stable during his stay .
He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry .
Cardiology consultation was obtained .
The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction .
Further Cardiologic work-up was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge .
The patient was started on Lopressor , Lipitor and Lisinopril .
3. After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions , the patient 's hematocrit remained stable at above 30 .
His INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge .
He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge .
4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying .
The need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient 's attending , Dr. Coleman , and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital , saturating well in room air .
5. Endocrine :
The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission .
His hemoglobin A1C was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge .
6. Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction .
Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol .
After this episode , the patient 's mental status remained clear for the rest of the duration of his stay .
7. Prophylaxis :
The patient was sent home on proton pump inhibitors .
His Helicobacter pylori serology was sent and was pending at the time of discharge .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home on the following medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day .
2. Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. twice a day .
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day .
4. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms p.o. q. day .

Brief Hospital Course :
55 year old man with history of metastatic bladder cancer and recurrent DVT s on Lovenox admitted with lower GI bleeding .
Right lower quadrant source of bleed on red blood cell scan .
Attempts to visualize colon by conventional and CT virtual colonoscopy failed because of sigmoid angulation and inadequate preparation , respectively .
On Ct scan , a right psoas mass , most consistent with a hematoma , was seen .
Since the hematocrit of the patient was stable and outside records from 2015-03-28 mentioned a mass in the right pelvis , the patient was discharged .
Lovenox was held until follow-up with primary care doctor .
Also , a repeat outpatient CT colonoscopy with better preparation should be considered .
Medications on Admission :
Lovenox 0.6 mg / kg SC BID
Discharge Medications :
1. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet , Delayed Release ( E.C. ) Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet , Delayed Release ( E.C. ) PO once a day .

You likely have a bleeding source in your colon that we have been unable to visualize .
The bleeding has stopped and you have remained hemodynamically stable and your hematocrit is stable , but you are at risk of bleeding from this source again with anticoagulation .
A CT scan of your abdomen showed a right pelvic mass , most likely a hematoma , which had been described previously in 2015-03-28 .
Please continue to take your other medications as prescribed .
Please follow up with your PCP as scheduled .
Please bring your outpatient lab results to your PCP ( Dr. Hemler )

No exudate .
Minimal bleeding .
Regular rate and rhythm .
Clear to auscultation .
Nontender , nondistended .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was initially admitted to CMED for resection and repair of this left facial lesion .
He also had consults from Urology for his hematuria as well as Medicine preoperatively and CMED CCU .
He went to the Operating Room on 2016-03-10 with Urology for hematuria where he had a cystoscopy transurethral resection of prostate placement .
He then went to the Operating Room on 2016-03-14 where he had resection of the left face squamous cell cancer by Dr. Langhorne and split thickness and full thickness skin grafting of the defects on 2016-03-14 .
He tolerated the procedure well with no complications except postoperatively , his voice was hoarse .
On scoping him he had significant supraglottic edema .
He was kept in the Unit for observation of his airway and b.i.d. laryngoscopy .
This revealed some supraglottic edema which revealed with time , without further intervention .
He was followed by Plastic Surgery for his split thickness skin graft and his bolster was discontinued on postoperative day #5 with good take up of his skin graft .
Urology also followed him and kept him on antibiotics until postoperative day #7 at which point antibiotics were discontinued .
His
Foley was also discontinued .
He is being discharged to rehabilitation to follow up for XRT given the fact that his pathology revealed squamous cell cancer extending deep to the margin as well as positive level II nodes .
Dr. Navarrete has been e-mailed and his secretary contacted for as soon as possible appointment for XRT follow up .
He should also follow up with Dr. Rankin and Dr. Langhorne .

A/P :
75 yo F s/p MIx4 , numerous cath , PAF , Inducible VTach s/p AICD and pacer with severe COPD / restrictive lung disease s/p fall with intertrochanteric fracture .
As per CMED CCU , pt requires emergent repair of intertrochanteric fracture to preserve neurovascular function .
Pt is a moderate risk for a needed emergent non-cardiac procedure .
Pt is medically cleared for procedure  , likely has some mile rate related ischemia .
1. Cards :
--- Pre-op B-blocker with goal HR < 70
--- No real utility in MIBI / cath prior to procedure gien previous caths with no significant lesions to be intervened on .
--- V-Tach : pt has AICD in place , however b-blocker should contorl Vtach for now .
--- B-blocker IV , Dilt PRN for PAF
--- Hold coumadin for afib given hx of upper GIB and surgery in AM
--- Continue ASA , plavix
--- ROMI , check AM ECG

CMED course :
ORIF with repair of neck fracture 2016-03-23 .
Had expected prolonged post-op extubation in PACU given COPD history , as with colon CA resection surgery .
In PM extubated , transferred to floor 2016-03-23 .
Late 03-23 found with afib and RVR , given beta blocker with min. response , started dilt. drip .
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n .
On 03-24 AM p/w with respiratory failure , continued tachycardia on dilt. gtt.
Transferred to unit and urgently intubated .
Of note , there was a question of misplaced NGT .
When NGT tube was pulled out , it was noted to have respiratory-like secretions .
Concern for aspiration of mediations to lungs .
However , evaluation of CXR revealed NGT coiled in esophagus .
Pt 's respiratory distress is most likely on setting of aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis in the setting of depressed mental status secondary to post-operative narcotics .
Pt was pan-cultured and switched from unasyn ( started at OSH for foot ulcer ) to zosyn .
Vanco was added for possible nosocomial infection .
CTA was performed which was negative for PE , but revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities c/w aspiration vs. pneumonia vs. edema .
Pt was weaned down on ventilator , minimal secretions noted .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have depressed mental status off all sedating medications ; mental status improved over the course of the day .
Pt was diuresed .
Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled on dilt drip .
Dilt drip was discontinued and metoprolol titrated up .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled in setting of rapid AF and were flat .
Initially , pt was noted to be dry with low FeNa and given IVF .
Then , noted to be volume overloaded and diuresed with lasix .
Pt had depressed mental status on transfer to CMED in setting of narcotics .
She was then started on propofol while intubated .
Head CT was negative for acute bleed , mass effect , or stroke .
Mental status improved during times when propofol was held .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have significantly depressed M.S. off propol improved off sedation .
All sedating medications including prn narcotics were held and mental status cleared somewhat .
s/p hip fx repair : started on lovenox for anti-coagulation .
Given standing NSAID , tylenol for pain control .
opiates used very sparingly in setting of MS change
On transfer to floor team from CMED active issues and plan included :
Resp failure / COPD :
Initially got steroids upon intubation .
Off for days now .
Extubated on 03-31 .
Still tachypneic and hypoxic on room air .
Lung sounds fairly clear .
? COPD vs atelectasis as cause of hypoxia .
On Blake , Nancy pe less likely
- atrovent standing .
prn albuterol only given A fib with RVR
- inhaled steroids
- obtaining pcp set of Reginald
Fever :
In the ICU .
Had received unasyn , vanc , zosyn during hospital course for cellulitis and other unclear reasons , including possible vent associated pna .
No true source found .
Afebrile > 24 hours off abx .
- culture if spikes .
No abx unless source found
a.fib with RVR - Has ppm , so can have lot of nodal agents .
Now rate controlled on metop 125 tid and dilt .
30 QID .
Titrate prn .
- continue nodal agents
- consider anti coag for cva prevention , but wait until ambulating better
CAD : on asa , b blocker , ace .
No statin .
need to clear with family
Heme - anemic .
Unclear baseline .
Possible anemia 03-02 operative blood loss .
Follow hct daily Goal > 28
Neck : never had c spine cleared by neurosurg .
Had fall pta with ? fx on initial CT , neg fx on f/u ct .
- flex / ext films done
- will clear with neursurg prior to removing hard collar
Overnight on pt 's first evening on the floor , she had episode of desaturation with inc O2 requirement ( 4L -> 6L -> sating 91% on NRB ) - CXR with worsening - non responsive to lasix .
Family meeting held and pt made clear wishes after extubation that she does not want to be intubated again and made DNR / DNI .
No BIPAP .
Now pt lethargic and min responsive .
All four children in pts room and agree on CMO - want to d/c c-collar and start morphine ggt .
Discussed with night float cover Dr. Dennis COmmander and Dr. Mike French .
Although Dr. Ray will be covering pt today , Dr. Stephanie Wilson spoke with family this morning and has noted that pt is CMO .
EP was called to deactivate pt dual chamber ICD as per family wishes .

History of Present Illness :
30-year-old woman with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary .
At ChelseaWomens ' , about 04-25 , she developed pseudomonal urosepsis and vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
She was transfered to AttleboroHospital after an arrest .
Her course was complicated by post-hypotensive coma as well as subarachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds .
Neurologists at RIH felt she had a poor prognosis , but communication between the medical team and family was strained and transfer was arranged to Mediplex Rehab Hospital for a second opinion .
Her outside course in more detail:
Patient transferred from Women and Infants Hospital to RI Hospital 2016-04-25 with weaknes , vag bleeding x several days , fever 102.5 , hypotension , hypoxic 84% on 4L NC , tachypnic to 30 , with labs significant for lactate 6.3 , wbc <1.0 , plt 9 , hgb 8.9 , and INR greater than lab threshold .

Continued to have recurrent fevers .
.
Seen by Urology who did not change stents given severe coagulopathy and worsening renal function .
Found to be in DIC and supported with daily blood products .
Seen by heme and GCSF started .
Despite aggressive blood product repletion patient poorly responsive 02-12 alloimmunization .
Plt count 1 on 2016-04-29 .
Supported on TPN for nutrition then switched to tube feeds .
Developed renal failure with Cr peak of 2.9.
Seen by renal who felt was c/w ATN .
.
Head CT done 05-04 with bilateral SAH and L temporal parenchymal hematoma .
Also with multiple masses consistent with metastasis .
Placed on Dilantin .
Neurosurgery consulted .
Felt secondary to low platelets with no surgical intervention indicated .
.
Mult family meetings given poor prognosis .
Initially decided not to escilate care and make DNR 05-05 .
Then progressed to withdrawal of care 05-06 with plan to extubate 05-07 .
However there was dissent among neurologists about patient 's ability to recover from the SAH while awaiting family members and the patient was changed to full code .
Given 48 hours off sedation with out change in mental status ( last morphine was 2016-05-07 ) .
Transferred to Mediplex Rehab Hospital for further work up .

2016-05-11 MRI head:
FINDINGS :
The sagittal T1 images demonstrate several areas of high signal along the sulci bilaterally which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhages .
There are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images , this could not be further confirmed .
A CT would help for further assessment if indicated .
There is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain .
There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes , which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema .
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen .
No herniation is identified .
Images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation .
There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage .
A CT would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci .
Gadolinium-enhanced MRI would also help for further assessment .
.
pCXR 2016-05-11 5:01am:
FINDINGS :
No prior comparisons .
Tip of the ETT projects roughly 5 cm above the carina .
A right IJ central venous line is at the level of the mid SVC .
Tip of the NGT is below the edge of the image .
IVC filter and probable NU stent catheter on the left also noted .
Heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique , no sizeable pneumothorax .
There is a somewhat wedge-shaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia .
No other confluent infiltrates are appreciated
.
pCXR 2016-05-11. 1:46pm:
1. Mild pulmonary edema .
2. Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis , aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations .
3. ETT 4 cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach .
.
EEG 2016-05-12:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing .
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy .
Medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation .
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing , and there were no epileptiform features
.
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram 2016-05-12 :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( LVEF>55% ) .
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal .
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation .
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .
There is no mitral valve prolapse .
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined .
There is no pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION :
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function .
No pericardial effusion .
.
pCXR 2016-05-13 :
Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved , probably resolving edema .
There is more rightward mediastinal shift , suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung .
Enlargement of the right hilus could represent adenopathy .
Whether to pursue this would depend upon clinical circumstances .
Heart size normal .
ET tube in standard placement .
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .
No appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions
.
pCXR 2016-05-14 :
Increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases , worsened slightly since 05-13 at 10:57 p.m.
Heart size is normal .
There is no pleural effusion .
The ET tube and right PICC line in standard placements .
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .
No pneumothorax .

Brief Hospital Course :
30 yo F with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to OSH 04-25 with pseudomonal urosepsis , vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
Course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology .
Transferred here for second opinion on poor prognosis .
.
# Neurologic - The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases , possible hemorrhages , and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury .
EEG was performed and revealed encephalopathy .
The patient 's neurologic exam ( performed after sedation removed >48 hours ) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity .
She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected ( hypernatremia , hyperphosphatemia ) , but neurologic exam was unchanged .
A family meeting on 2016-05-13 was held and these findings communicated with the patient 's family .
Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning .
At the request of her family , she will be transferred closer to her home in Wyoming , to Women and
Infants hospital .
.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation , which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable .
She was originally intubated for airway protection , and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration .
Due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home , she will remain intubated until transfer , with plan to extubate upon arrival to Women and Infants hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of DNI status .
.
# Fevers/Infection - Per outside hospital records , the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine .
At OSH , she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin , as well as 13 days ( of 14-day planned course ) of Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn .
She was intially continued on Cipro/Zosyn .
CXR 05-11 revealed ? pneumonia vs atelectasis at the R lung base .
Continues to spike fever .
Could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube .
Urology at OSH against pulling tube because coagulopathy and may not be able to replace .
Fevers also may be from head bleed , cancer , or drug .
She was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course .
She continued to have fevers .
Antibiotics were discontinued on 05-15 .
No further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process .
.
# Squamous Cell Cancer - unknown primary .
The patient was seen by the oncology consult service who contacted her outside hematologist Dr. Pauling .
Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin .
She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia ( 40-50K ) .
Given this we were unable to offer her additional therapy. Hematology/Oncology service at Mediplex Rehab Hospital confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment .
.
# h/o DVT - patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation .
IVC filter in place .

EKG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm , nl axis , nl int , LVH w/ strain pattern , no ischemic changes .
CXR :
Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , and  particularly the left atrium accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure .
Conclusions :
The left atrium is moderately dilated .
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis .
No left ventricular thrombus is seen .
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP > 18 mmHg ).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe free wall hypokinesis .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are minimally thickened .
No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is seen .
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .
There is no mitral valve prolapse .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION : Moderate symmetric eft ventricular hypertrophy with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process ( toxin , metabolic , cannot exclude myocarditis ; in the absence of LVH on ECG , an infiltrative process should also be considered ).
Mild mitral regurgitation .
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion .
Possible abnormality on the aortic valve as described above without aortic regurgitation .
If clinically indicated a TEE would be better able to define an abnormality of the aortic valve .
Brief Hospital Course :
46 - yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use complicated by hypertensive urgency .
Hypertensive urgency :
BP 230/170 on presentation , most likely from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use .
No signs of end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine , which is more likely a chronic problem .
The patient was started on labetalol and Lisinopril .
His blood pressure was taken down from 230 systolic to approx 160 systolic / 100 diastolic on discharge .
His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis .
An echo performed on admission showed an LF EF of 25% .
It is hoped with good blood pressure control and use of an ACE-I with follow up in addition to cocaine abstaining will improved his cardiac function .
Renal Failure : creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing hypertensive disease .
discharged on ACE-I .
Substance Use : Social work saw patient and counceled him regarding substance abuse .
Discharged with Margaret Hallock , cardiology follow up as well as scheduled appointment with a new PCP @ Newton Health Center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 year old man with history of hypercholesterolemia and type II diabetes mellitus .
He has a recent history of dyspnea on exertion on exertional chest pain which has increased over the last several weeks and is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin .
On 2016-06-26 , he had a positive exercise tolerance test .
Cardiac catheterization at the end of October revealed a dilated aortic root to 4.4 cm and 80% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch , 70% stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and 90% stenosis of the posterior descending artery .
His atrioventricular valve gradient was 27 with an AV surface area of .91 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems shows that the patient denies any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
He has no bleeding or clotting problems .
Juanita does not feel any palpitations .
He does not have wheezing , claudication or gastrointestinal bleeding .
Nor does he have any history of stroke like symptoms .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient is afebrile .
Weight is 82 kilograms .
Blood pressure 126/66 .
General :
Active , well-developed , well-nourished male .
Head and neck examination :
No bruits appreciated .
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Heart was regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 .
3/6 systolic ejection murmur throughout his precordium .
His abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended .
No hepatosplenomegaly and no CVA tenderness .
Extremities are warm , well perfused , no cyanosis , clubbing or
edema .
Palpable dorsalis pedis pulses .
No varicosities noted .
The patient was also noted to be right handed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft .
Once consent and preoperative evaluation was complete , he was taken to the operating room .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016-12-30 by Dr. Lawrence .
Briefly , the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis , his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm .
The procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve , a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed .
The left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery , diagonal branch , obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending .
Finally , a super coronary arch graft was implanted .
This was a .................... graft .
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes .
His aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes .
He had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit , intubated on Milrinone , Levophed and Propofol drips .
The rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach .
Pulmonary :
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .
After that , the patient had no major problems with his lungs .
His oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation .
He was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven .
After an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion .
Neurologic :
The major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued .
Because of his confusion , a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres , suggestive of more chronic infarcts , as well as an area in the left corona radiata , adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct .
This was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one , 12-31 .
As the patient became more awake , he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it .
In addition , he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia .
Over his postoperative course , Mr. Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy , he has 4 to 5 + strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 + strength in his right leg .
He is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge , with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses .
In addition , Mr. Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night .
A psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder , except for perhaps postoperative delirium .
Cardiovascularly , the patient did extremely well following the surgery .
The Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one .
Milrinone was continued until postoperative day number three , at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore .
He has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean , dry and intact at the end of the procedure .
In addition , he has hypertension , for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia , for which he receives nothing at this time .
Pulmonary :
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .
He was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air .
Gastrointestinal :
The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease , for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient .
We will put him back on his Nexium .
In addition , over the last couple of days prior to discharge , the patient did appear a little bit icteric .
Liver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was 44 , AST was 34 ; alkaline phosphatase was 199 , within normal limits .
Total bilirubin was 2.8 .
Amylase was 108 and lipase was 213 .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis .
In addition , the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level .
The ideal blood sugar levels for Mr. Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 .
Please stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level .
Hematologic :
The patient , during this admission , required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit .
At the time of discharge , Mr. Norman hematocrit is at 40.7 .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight , most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke .
Once he was coherent enough , the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who
declared him at first an aspiration risk .
As Mr. Douglass has improved from his initial stroke , he has become more lucid
and is less of an aspiration risk .
On 01-12 , one day prior to discharge , he was cleared by the swallow team to eat
a diet as he wishes .
He is going out on a cardiac healthy , diabetic diet , as tolerated with Boost supplements .
Infectious disease :
The patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01-05 for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which was pan sensitive .
He was started on Oct. 25 for this bug .
On 01-08 , the patient 's central venous line was discontinued .
The catheterization tip also grew out Serratia .
On the 16th , a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin .
He was started on Bactrim for that .
Please continue Mr. David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection , to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E. coli in his urine .
DISPOSITION :
Mr. Douglass is being discharged on 2017-01-13 to a rehabilitation facility in good condition .
FOLLOW-UP :
One to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month with Dr. Costello .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary , patient is a 53 - year-old female with multiple medical problems and history of depression with intentional overdose of barbiturates , opiates , Tylenol , and beta blocker .
CMED :
Patient was maintained on insulin , D10 and glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics .
This was achieved with good effect , and they were subsequently weaned off .
Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three .
Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated , and felt that patient had a high suicide risk , and plan was for her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically stable .
Patient 's renal function remained stable and her CKs trended down gradually .
Patient remained on suicide precautions , but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring , and was transferred to the floor on 01-11 .
In the a.m. of 01/08 , the patient experienced episode of tongue biting , unresponsiveness , disorientation .
Was loaded on Dilantin .
Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max respiratory rate of 116 , tachycardia to 120s .
Patient subsequently was transferred back to the CMED CCU on 2017-01-13 for further monitoring .
Patient 's hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia .
She was started on appropriate antibiotics .
Etiology of patient 's tachypnea was unclear .
Initially , the patient 's etiology of seizure was not quite clear , but thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal .
She received EEG , MRI , LP .
Subsequently EEG was noted to have no seizure activity .
MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable .
Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG , patient was continued on Dilantin .
Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic , but gradually improved slowly , and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal .
Her mental status , tachypnea , and hypoxia all improved , and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on 2017-01-15 .
While on the floor , the patient 's mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU , and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate withdrawal .
She was continued on suicide precautions with a one-to-one sitter , and plan was for psychiatric admission when medical issues had resolved .
On 2017-01-16 , the night float intern was called to see the patient as she was unresponsive .
Patient unresponsive to verbal command , sternal rub .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes , spontaneous breathing , heart sounds , or palpable pulses .
Patient was pronounced dead at 6:15 a.m. on 2017-01-16 .
Patient 's family was notified and declined autopsy .
Given the sudden unexpected nature of patient 's death , the medical examiner was contacted and the case was accepted .
Of note at time of death , patient was DNR / DNI .
This was initiated after several conversations with the patient 's mother , who stated that the patient had desired to be DNR / DNI for many years , not just in the recent past .
These facts were confirmed via separate conversations with both the patient 's lawyer and her primary care physician .

Pertinent Results :
CT chest 2017-02-06
IMPRESSION :
1. Extensive bilateral diffuse ground glass and more confluent areas of consolidation in both lungs consistent with the recent chest x-ray .
This non - specific pattern could represent diffuse pneumonia complicated by ARDS .
This would likely less represent asymmetric pulmonary edema .
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions .
Echo 2018-02-06
Conclusions :
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler .
2. Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( LVEF > 55% ) .
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
4. The ascending , transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque .
5. The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve .
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen .
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve .
7. No vegetation / mass is seen on the pulmonic valve .
8. There is a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .
Head CT 2017-02-08
FINDINGS :
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified .
There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures .
No major vascular territorial infarction is identified .
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and symmetrical .
No osseous lesions are seen .
IMPRESSION :
No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute infarction .
EEG 2017-02-10
IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a low voltage and slow background consistent with a severe encephalopathy of toxic , metabolic , or anoxic etiology .
Note that with the documented movements of the patient 's head and mouth , no change on the EEG was seen .
No evidence of ongoing seizures was seen .

Brief Hospital Course :
1) Respiratory failure :
On admission , this was felt to be likely 03-15 worsening PNA .
Pt remained intubated until 2017-02-14 .
He had difficulty weaning from the vent due to difficulties with neurological status ( he remained drowsy and unresponsive for many days ) but eventually awoke enough and was extubated without difficulty and remained stable on 3L NC .
He was transferred to the floor but a few days later began to show signs of respiratory distress and was transferred back to the CMED CSRU for reintubation for likely aspiration event leading to worsening pneumonia as well as some component of pulm edema .
He was extubated a few days later and transferred back to the floor where his pulm status improved dramatically with lasix and continued nebulizer treatments .
The patient was prepared for discharge on 05-29 , when he was sat ' ing in the high 90 's on room air .
However , on 2017-03-01 at 6 am the pt was found with labored respirations ( rr = 24 ) and SaO2 89% , which improved to only SaO290 - 91% on 100% NRB .
ABG ( 7.42 / 38 / 88 ) was performed , 80 mg lasix was given and the patietn had foley placed and had good urine output and good mentation .
He was also given nebulizers without improvement .
His chest radiograph had fluffy bilateral infiltrates .
Although the pt was w/o fever , he had chills .
He was readmitted tot he CMED CSRU for respiratory distress likely secondary to a recurrent aspiration event .
He was continued on meropenem , started on BiPAP and aggressively suctioned in an attempt to avoid intubation .
On 03-02 at 10 am , the patient had an acutechange in mental status with bradycardia , hypertension , pinpoint pupils , decerebrate posturing and increased tone in bilateral upper extremities and unresponsiveness .
The patient was brought to CT immediately for stat scan and was found to have a massive occipital spontaneous hemorrhage into the L ventricle requiring ventricular drainage .
Neurosurgery was immediately called for an EVD and anesthesia was called STAT to the bedside for intubation at 10:45 am in order to assist in hyperventilation .
After endotracheal intubation , MAPs were maintained between 70 and 90 , dilantin was dose to maintain an appropriate level .
L frontal ICP bolt was placed by neurosurgery under sterile conditions on antibiotics .
Mannitol 75 mg iv x 1 then 50 gm iv tid was begun to maintain serum osm > 320 and Na > 147 .
The patient was hyperventilated to goal PCO2 30-35 with ICP improvement .
Serial head CT studies and neurologic exams were performed but the patient was unchaged , unresponsive with posturing and no spontaneous movement despite ICP being maintained in good range ( < 20 ).
On 2017-03-03 , a family meeting resulted in the patient 's code being changed to comfort measures only .
The patient was terminally extubated on a morphine drip and ativan titrated for agonal breathing and discomfort ; scopolamine was used as an adjunct to control secretions and appeared comfortable when he died at 12:27 pm on 2017-03-04 .
The family refused autopsy or post-mortem examination to deduce secondary causes of death .
2. ID - Bacteremia and PNA :
Pt 's triple lumen catheter was found to be growing coag neg staph . and PICC tip and sputum growing enterobacter cloacae .
The PICC was d/c 'ed and pt was continued on vancomycin ( for course of 6 weeks ) and meropenem was added on 02-09 ( for 3 week course ).
TEE was negative .
Pt finished the 3 week course of meropenem while in house and was discharged to rehab on day 34/42 of the vancomycin .
3) AIN :
Pt received oxacillin during his prior hospitalization and had AIN from this medication .
On this admission he was continued on prednisone taper .
Fluoroquinolones and other renal toxins were avoided .
Renal function gradually improved and Cr trended down from peak of 7.6 to 1.4 .
Before the patient acutely decompensated as above , the plan was for steroid taper :
60 mg x 10 days ( already completed ) , 40 mg x 14 d ( already completed ) , 20 mg x 14 d ( now day 11-24 ) , 10 mg x 10 d , 5 mg x 10 d .
4) Foot ulcer : The pt was followed by podiatry and had several further debridement of his R heel wound .
on abx , podiatry following , changed vac q3 days .
5) Encephalopathy : It was unclear why the pt 's mental status initially did not improve more quickly after all sedatives were removed and he was extubated .
His MS waxed and waned for many days and uremia vs. failure to clear sedatives were considered ( although pt was making urine and LFT 's are wnl ).
The pt had an EEG and 2 head CT 's which did not show anoxic brain injury or bleeding .
He gradually improved and was A&Ox3 and near baseline before Amesbury Hospital transferred to the CMED CSRU in respiratory distress .
6) DM :
Pt was maintained on SSI with small amount of standing insulin while he was NPO and then his dose was gradually increased as he received tube feeds .
7) FEN :
The pt had an NG tube placed and received tube feeds for the majority of his hospitalization .
Upon extubation and transfer to the floor he pulled out the NG tube time several times and required restraints .
Albumin was very low and pt had significant edema likely 03-15 this .
A few days before decompensating , his mental status improved to the degree that he was able to eat normal food without aspirating .
8) CV :
Pump / HTN : pt had episodes of both hypertension and hypotension during his stay .
He was managed with Metoprolol , Hydralazine , and Amlodipine .
Near discharge his BP was controlled with Metoprolol only .
9) Hypernatremia - While in the CMED CSRU the pt developed hypernatremia .
This was felt to be likely 03-15 intravascular volume depletion since the pt 's albumin was so low and he was third spacing all of his fluid .
He was volume resuscitated and managed with D5W and lasix as well as receving FW boluses with his NG tube feeds .
The hypernatremia fully resolved when he resumed eating on his own and had access to free water .
10) Anemia :
Pt 's Hct trended down slowly throughout his hospitalization .
Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease .
He was transfused 3 units pRBC 's near the end of his hospitalization and had an appropriate bump .
11) CMED CCU :
When the pt 's MS improved to near baseline before again decompensating , he became extremely tearful and expressed feelings of depression after being in the hospital for so long .
He expressed interest in taking an anti-depressant for a short time while he was recovering and was started on Celexa .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Jadiara Harrison is twin #1 born to a 17 year-old primiparous mother at 31 weeks gestation .
Mother was admitted to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital from Lawrence General Hospital Hospital on 05-01 with cervical effacement and preterm labor .
She was treated with magnesium sulfate .
She had previously been admitted here at the 24th week after a motor vehicle accident. She was treated with tocolysis and betamethasone at that time .
Due to progressing labor and presentation of twins , delivery was by Cesarean section .
Prenatal screens were notable for blood type 0 positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive .
Rubella status was not documented .
Group B strep status was unknown .
Infant emerged from the breech position .
She was vigorous .
She was given blow-by oxygen and stimulation .
Her Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes .
She was brought to the CMED CSRU for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
ON admission , physical examination reveals a non dysmorphic infant , well saturated and perfused with multiple bruises noted over the upper legs , left arm and chest .
No bony abnormalities or petechiae noted .
She was moving all joints and extremities well .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
CV :
Normal S1 and S2 without a murmur .
Lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
Genitalia normal .
Premature female .
Neuro :
Non focal and age appropriate .
Hips normal , held in the breech position .
Anus patent .
Spine intact .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , infant did not require supplemental oxygen or respiratory support .
Since that time , Jadiara has always been in room air without requiring supplemental oxygen .
She was noted to have apnea of prematurity , treated with caffeine until 2017-06-04 .
Since that time , she has had very rare spells , with none for over one week by the time of discharge .
Cardiovascular :
She was hemodynamically stable upon admission with normal blood pressures and heart rate .
On day of life 15 , she was noted to have a murmur , eventually prompting evaluation by ECHO .
The ECHO revealed an anomalous left coronary , with one end entering the right ventricular outflow tract and the other end not clearly defined .
It was unable to be delineated whether this represented an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery ( LCAPA ) or a left coronary artery fistula to the pulmonar artery .
The right coronary was prominent , and there appeared to be coronary artery collateral vessels in the posterior apical myocardium .
A small apical muscular VSD was also noted .
Several additional ECHOs were performed , including an ECHO in the cardiology department at HealthSouth Rehab Hospital of Western Mass. , but the anatomy of the left coronary artery could not be further defined .
Due to the risks of coronary ischemia if this represented an LCAPA , the infant was followed with regular ECHOs and EKGs during the remainder of hospitalization , with no evidence of ischemia , valvular regurgitation , or compromised ventricular function .
She will be continued to be followed closely by cardiology as an outpatient , with likely plans for cardiac catheterization and surgical repair when she grows to 3.5 to 4 kg .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The infant was initially maintained on IVF , with introduction of enteral feeds on day of life 2 .
She was advanced to full volume enteral feeds by day of life 7 , and then to a maximum caloric density of 28 cals / oz .
Oral feedings were introduced as tolerated .
By the time of discharge , infant is feedign BM or enfamil 24 cals / oz PO ad lib , with adequate intake and adequate weight gain .
Last nutrition labs were on 06-20 with AP of 208 , Ca 10.8 , and Phos 7.4.
Gastrointestinal :
The infant required phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia through day of life 7 , with peak bilirubin of 7 / 0.3 on day of life 3 , and last bilirubin of 4.9 / 0.3 on day of life 9 .
Hematologic / Infectious disease :
CBC and blood culture were obtained upon admission revealing a white blood cell count of 9.0 with 25 polys and 0 bands ; hematocrit was 46.9% and platelets of 222,000 .
Baby received 48 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin with negative cultures and a stable clinical course .
Infant was treated with supplemental iron , and did not receive any blood transfusions .
Last Hct was 30.6 on 06-20 with a reticulocyte count of 6.5%.
Neurologic :
Baby has been appropriate for gestational age .
Social :
Mother is 17 years old , and has been accompanied on the majority of her visits by her parents , both of whom are students .
The infant 's maternal grandparents have been very involved in her care .
Sensory :
Initial opthalmologic exam on 06-05 revealed immature retinas in zone 3 , and repeat exam on 06-26 revealed mature retinas bilaterally .
Infant passed hearing screen prior to discharge .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
To home .
PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN :

INTERPRETATION :
Findings :
This study was compared to the prior study of 2017-06-01 .
LEFT ATRIUM :
Normal LA size .
LEFT VENTRICLE :
Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images .
Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size .
Suboptimal technical quality , a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
No resting LVOT gradient .
RIGHT VENTRICLE :
Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion .
AORTA :
Normal aortic root diameter .
Focal calcifications in aortic root .
AORTIC VALVE :
Normal aortic valve leaflets .
No AR .
MITRAL VALVE :
Normal mitral valve leaflets .
Mild ( 1+ ) MR .
TRICUSPID VALVE :
Mild PA systolic hypertension .
PERICARDIUM :
No pericardial effusion .
GENERAL COMMENTS :
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows .
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .
Conclusions :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal .
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
Overall systolic function is good ( LVEF > 40% ).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .
No aortic regurgitation is seen .
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION :
Good global biventricular systolic function .
Mild mitral regurgitation .
The prior study of 2017-06-01 ( tape reviewed ) was of very suboptimal technical quality and not directly comparable to the current study .
If more definitive information regarding ventricualr fuynction is needed , a cardiac MRI ( ( 951 ) 247-0244 ) or radionuclide study is suggested .
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .

Brief Hospital Course:
Pleural effusion : s/p pigtail cath drain .
Imaging indicated that the pleural effusions had resolved .
Thoracics agreed to no need for pigtail placement .
CHF :
Patient was seen by CHF ( echo results are detailed above ) .
They recommended continuing beta-blocker and titarting ace as tolerated .
Patient should be kept euvolemic once peripheral edema resolves ( may use lasix to decrease edema ).
She will need a repeat echo in 3-6 months ( since this echo showed a question of focal wall motion abnormality ).
Also , patient was started on amiodarone and digoxin was held secondary to high levels ( please restart when level less than 2 )
Diarrhea :
Stool c. diff neg x1 .
She will need two more specimens .
COPD : cont nebs .
PAF : started on amio , cont b-blocker , and patient was started on coumadin - levels ( inr ) should be monitored .
Nutrition :
Patient should be started on tube feeds at rehab
Rash :
Patient developed a diffuse erythematous rash , though to be an ID reaction to a recent fungal infection .
She has been satrted on benadryl and hydrocort for sx relief .
Please monitor this ( may need dermatology consult ).
Also a drug reaction is in the ddx but unlikely as rash started at rehab prior to receiving drugs here .

Chief Complaint :
Fever , tachycardia
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
None
History of Present Illness :
Patient is a 58 year old male with a recent admission for abdominal pain s/p negative exploratory laparotomy for suspected intussuception now returns on day of discharge with fever and tachycardia .
Patient has a history for terrible vasculopathy s/p recent right BKA with dry gangrene of the distal stump .
Patient 's last admission was significant for a negative ex-lap .
Post-operatively , his course was complicated by respiratory distress necessitating an urgent return to the ICU and was intubated .
After multuple failed attempts at extubation , the patient was trached .
Patient then did well on a trach mask and was transferred to rehab on the day of admission but now returns with tachycardia to the 120 's , and fever to 102 degrees F .

Pertinent Results :
MRI HEAD :
The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion to indicate acute infarct .
There is moderate prominence of ventricles and sulci , inappropriate for the patient 's age .
There is no midline shift , mass effect , hydrocephalus , or territorial infarct .
Following gadolinium , no evidence of abnormal parenchymal , vascular , or meningeal enhancement seen .
Gastric biopsy : negative for H. pylori .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was re-admitted to the surgical service and taken to the CMED .
A chest x-ray on admission showed effusions consistent with CHF along with overlying pnumonia .
Urine cultures were significant for Klebsiella UTI and sputum cultures were significant for MRSA .
He was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin and fluconazole .
He underwent PICC line placement on 06-18 .
A trach collar was placed on 06-19 .
GI was consulted for colonoscopy .
Patient was transferred to the floor on 06-20 .
He was seen by respiratory therapy and suctioned continually throughout his hospital course .
His respiratory status improved .
He tolerated his trach collar , and tube feeds at goal .
The fluconazole was discontinued .
On 06-21 the patient was seen by physical therapy .
A nutrition consult was obtained on 06-22 .
He underwent a failed bedside swallow study .
Based on a chest x-ray that showed a small hydro-pneumothorax on the left lower lobe of the lung , a thoracic surgery consult was obtained , though no specific interventions were warranted at the time .
On 06-23 the patient 's tube feed were changed from Respalor to Deliver 2.0 to give increased calories .
On 06-25 , urine cultures grew out VRE , and a C diff was negative .
He experienced low grade fevers .
He was pan-cultured on 06-26 for continued fevers .
On 06-27 , his nutrition regimen was changed to Deliver 2.0 at 70 cc / hr with 15 g ProMod .
On 06-28 , the patient experienced PVC 's .
An EKG showed ST segment depression along the lateral pre-cordial leads .
Serial enzymes showed mild elevation of troponins .
A cardiology consult was obtained .
The cardiology service simply recommended increasing the beta-blockade and maximizing the patient 's electrolyte status .
On 06-29 , the patient was transferred to the medical service .
Pt 's vancomycin was stopped after 14 days of treatment .
HIV test was found to be negative .
MRI head was obtained to further w/u patient 's apparent cognitive decline .
MRI showed prominent sulci and enlarged ventricles abnormal for the patient 's age .
Due to concerns for dementia , neurology consult was obtained .
Neurology felt that the patient 's cognitive symptoms were consistent w/ metabolic encephalopathy due to his multiple medical problems .
They felt that his mental status would improve as his health improved .
Underlying dementia was possible but difficult to assess with an overlying delerium .
The patient continued to pull out his doboff tube .
Pt had EGD performed to evaluate his poor nutritional status .
He was found to have a large gastric ulcer and high dose PPI was started .
The gastric biopsy and the serology were both negative for H. pylori .
PEG placement was unsuccessful by GI due to the patient 's anantomy .
07-05 the patient had a J tube placed in interventional radiology for nutritional support .
He was re-started on tube feeds .
07-06 patient failed a repeat swallow evaluation due to discoordinated swallow .
07-07 the patient was taken for colonoscopy and found to have a normal colon to cecum .
07-12 the patient was found to be C diff positive and was started on 14 day course of Flagyl .
On 07-18 , as his mental status improved , he did well at the bed side swall evaluation .
On 07-19 , he underwent video swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate ground consistent food and thin liquids .
His meds should be crushed and mixed with puree thick liquid .
He has gained 30 lb since the tubefeed was initiated ( 70 lb to 100 lb ) during this admission .
He will still need to be on tubefeed to support his nutrition until he is cleared by a nutritionist .
In terms of his mental status , he continued to improve steadily over the last few weeks of his hospital stay .
He was more alert and engaged with activity .
He did much better with PT and OT at the end after his mental status improved .
As noted above , his mental status change was likely toxic-metabolic from acute infection .
He started to develop more pain around the right stump since 07-17 .
He was seen by the vascular surgery who felt that he is too medically sick and malnourished to have surgery at this time .
He will follow up with Dr. Javier as outpatient .
Initially , his pain was controlled with titrating up the Oxycontin .
However , it was titrated too quickly from 10 mg bid to 30 mg bid .
He then developed urinary retention requiring foley placement .
After he passed the video swallowing , he was tolerating ground consistent solids .
On 07-24 , he had an emesis x 1 , and had aspiration pneumonia ( + interstital markings on the left on CXR , fever , leukocytosis ) .
His Flagyl course was extended , and Vanc / Levo were added .
His sputum showed many GPC which later grew Staph aureus .
Given his recent MRSA pneumonia , he will be treated with 2 week course of Vanc / Levo / Flagyl .
He was seen by the pain service who recommended to discontinue Oxycontin , and start Neurontin , MSIR , and lidocaine patch in addition to the standing Tylenol .
On 07-25 , his J-tube was noted to be obstructed but was able to be flushed by IR on 07-26 .
Tubefeed was resumed without any difficulty since .
Since oxycontin was discontinued , the foley was removed on 07-27 and was able to void without any difficulty .

ST changes as compared to 2017-05-01 EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction .
However , with her history of disease , patient underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent , otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses .
The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications .
It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient , then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and Plavix .
The patient was sent to the CCU and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol , which she tolerated well .
She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks , which was relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol .
The patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her Benadryl that she takes for sleep , that the asthma exacerbation did not occur .
Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient , and she is going to take this as an outpatient .
2. Hyperlipidemia :
The patient 's Lipitor was increased to 80 mg q.d.
3. Back pain :
This is a chronic issue and was controlled with Flexeril and Vicodin .
DISPOSITION :
To home .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
Patient is able to ambulate without any chest pain or discomfort .
Can carry out all activities of daily living .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.
2. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
3. Advair 550 mcg two puffs b.i.d.
4. Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
6. Montelukast 10 mg q.d.
7. Bethanechol 25 mg b.i.d.
8. Docusate sodium 100 mg b.i.d.
9. Zetia 10 mg q.d.
10. Estrogen 0.3 mg q.d.
11. Fluoxetine 40 mg q.d.
12. Vicodin 5-500 mg tablets q.4-6h. as needed for pain .

IMAGING :
2017-08-14 CXR :
ETT in correct position .
PM wires in good position .
S/p right pneumonectomy .
Blunting of left CPA likely effusion .
New lower left lateral CW opacity , likely loculated pleural fluid .
2017-07-19 ECHO :
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum .
LVEF 25% .
Resting WMA include mid to distal septal akinesis , apical akinesis , inferior akinesis/hypokinesis , and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis / akinesis .
No definite apical thrombus seen ( cannot exclude ).
01-22+ AR .
Trivial MR .
1+ TR .
2017-08-16 CT head :
New rounded low-density area measuring 2.5 cm in left basal ganglia , which partially extends to the left thalamus , probably representing subacute infarction .
On this head CT without contrast , the evaluation is limited .
2017-08-16 CTA chest :
No evidence for pulmonary embolism .
Findings consistent with failure or fluid overload .
Development of small loculated pleural fluid collection along the periphery of the left major fissure or so-called pseudotumor , consistent with the recent chest x-ray .
Unchanged appearance of right pneumonectomy .
2017-08-16 ECHO :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Overall LVEF is difficult to assess due to poor echo windows although the basal LV appeas hyperdynamic without regional contraction abnormality ( suspect significant improvement compared to prior study dated 2017-07-18 ).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle ( due to poor echo windows cannot fully exclude ).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated .
There is no aortic valve stenosis .
Mild ( 1+ ) aortic regurgitation is seen .
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen .
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation .
There is a small pericardial effusion .
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade
2017-08-17 EEG :
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage suppression over the left hemisphere and due to the bursts of generalized slowing and right hemisphere slowing .
The first abnormality raises the possibility of material ( such as subdural fluid ) interposed between the brain and recording electrodes or widespread cortical dysfunction on that side .
Anatomic correlation would be of interest if clinically indicated .
The generalized slowing indicates a non specific dysfunction in midline structures .
There was also evidence of subcortical dysfunction on the right side .
No epileptiform features were seen .

Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .
Both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .
However , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .
He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT , MRI , LP , and EEG .
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .
However , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .
This was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .
The end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .
The family was present .

The patient was currently at Hubbard Regional Hospital and began to develop worsening SOB for the past 5 days .
This AM while talking with his daughter on the phone , he was noted to desaturate into the high 80s and he was brought to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
The patient states that he has felt "" cloudy "" of late which seems to relate to his worsening SOB .
He is not ambulatory and is very deconditioned secondary to several complications within the past two months related to an AICD pocket infection .
He denies any CP , N/V/D , abdominal pain , or HA .
He states that he only uses one pillow to sleep but admits to sleeping at about 30 degrees at rehab .

Imaging Studies :
1. CXR ( PA/Lateral ) 2017-09-03
Congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions ( R > L ) , with possible underlying consolidation in the RLL and to a lesser degree the RML and LLL .
2. CXR 2017-09-04
Compared to PA and lateral chest of the prior day .
Right-sided PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC .
The heart is markedly enlarged .
There remains a large right and small left pleural effusion , not significantly changed .
Patient remains in congestive heart failure , though it may be slightly improved compared to the prior study .
Underlying infectious consolidation in the right lower lobe not excluded .
3. Echo 2017-09-04
The left atrium is mildly dilated .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
LV systolic function appears depressed .
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .
Right ventricular chamber size is normal and free wall motion may be mildly impaired .
The aortic root is mildly dilated .
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated .
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present .
The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally .
The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis .
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality , with elevated left atrial pressure .
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV ( severe ) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction .
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2017-08-14 , ventricular function is now similar.
EF 35-40% .
4. Echo 2017-09-14
The left atrium is mildly dilated .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed .
3l .
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is no pericardial effusion .
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2017-09-04 , there is probably no significant change .
All cultures , including BCx , UCx , pleural fluid culture , and wound culture have been negative .
5. CT Chest 2017-09-16 :
1. Increasing large right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary edema .
Scattered parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe represent superimposed infection vs atelectasis .
There is no evidence of abscess .
6. 2017-09-28 Chest X Ray :
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST .
There has been almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .
A small right pleural effusion has decreased in size .
Mild cardiomegaly is stable .
There is no pneumothorax .
Right PIC catheter tip ends in the lower SVC .
Patient is post median sternotomy .
IMPRESSION :
Almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .
7. 2017-09-29 CT Head :
FINDINGS :
There is no evidence of intraaxial or extraaxial hemorrhage , mass effect , shift of normally midline structures , or acute major or minor vascular territorial infarction .
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent , but stable in size and appearance .
The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved .
Again seen are subtle hypodensities within the periventricular white matter which is an indication of chronic microvascular ischemic changes , stable .
Extensive carotid artery calcifications are identified .
The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear .
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .
IMPRESSION :
No evidence of acute or chronic infarction .
Stable microvascular ischemic changes in the periventricular white matter .
8. 2017-09-30 EEG :
IMPRESSION :
Abnormal EEG due to the moderately slow posterior background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing .
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures .
Medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .
No prominent focal abnormalities were evident , and there were no epileptiform features .
The cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a PACED rhythm .

Pt. was initially admitted to CCU on 2017-09-03 , transferred to Pendleton on 2017-09-05 , triggered on 2017-09-10 for hypotension with BP 67/38 and transferred back to CCU on 2017-09-10 .
He remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed .
The following issues were addressed during this hospital admission :
1# Cardiac :
Pump
The patient was initially admitted for likely CHF exacerbation .
He was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response .
He continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .
While on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .
After several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .
He was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .
He was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt .
He diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported .
Gradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .
However , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .
A swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .
He also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .
The Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .
He was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .
The patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .
It was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .
The patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .
At discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .
His dry weight is 70.4 kg .
Ischemia
The patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation .
He was continued on Aspirin , Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues .
Rhythm
The patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .
He is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .
His underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .
Anti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .
The patient 's INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .
His coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .
His INR continued to flucuate .
He was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .
His INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .
His INR goal is 02-24 .
2# SOB on admission :
Likely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .
He had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .
It appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .
On discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .
3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :
Etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .
This acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .
The patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .
His CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .
All sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .
4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .
Gram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .
The right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .
Repeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications
5# T2DM :
The patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .
He was monitored with QID fingersticks .
His blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .
6# Hyperlipidemia :
The patient was continued on his statin .
7# COPD :
The patient was continued on nebs
8# MS changes :
The patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .
His mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .
Neurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .
An EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .
His mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .
9# Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .
10# ? UTI :
The patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .
UCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c 'd .
11# Chronic lower back pain :
The patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .
Stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .
12# Wound Care :
The patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .
Wound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .
For the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .
For the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .
These recommendations were followed throughout the admission .
13# Voiding :
Pt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .
Case was discussed with neurology .
He was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .
He is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .
Until then , his foley should remain in place .

The patient was full code during admission .

HISTORY :
Peggy Hammock is a full term baby boy born at 38 1/7 weeks by repeat cesarean section to a 34 year old gravida III , now para II mother .
Serologies include blood type O negative , antibody negative , RPR nonreactive .
Hepatitis B surface antigen negative , rubella immune .
Group B strep screening was negative .
Pregnancy was uncomplicated until an occurrence of HSV outbreak occurred on 2017-09-13 approximately one week prior to delivery .
Pregnancy was also complicated by maternal history of depression for which mother received Zoloft .
On day of delivery mother presented in spontaneous labor .
There were no sepsis risk factors .
GBS negative .
No maternal fever .
Rupture of membranes at time of delivery .
Delivery was by repeat cesarean section and Apgars of 8 and 9 were given at one and five minutes respectively .
Baby appeared well and went to the newborn nursery and was breast feeding and undergoing routine newborn care .
On the newborn nursery the mother called the nurse for concern of baby turning dusky while feeding .
She called the nurses and patted the infant on the back .
This episode was also accompanied by gagging motions noted of the infant .
A second episode occurred where the baby turned pale .
Mother thought the baby just did not look right .
The baby did not turn blue at that time .
The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was notified and the baby was transferred to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit :
Full term well appearing infant with some facial jaundice , overall pink , warm and well perfused , alert and responsive .
Anterior fontanelle is soft , open and flat .
Ears are normally set .
Red reflexes noted bilaterally .
He had a left pupil that was in unequal in size with a keyhole appearance consistent with a coloboma .
The nares were patent .
Palate was intact .
Mucous membranes were moist and pink .
His neck was supple without masses or bruits .
Lungs were clear to auscultation and equal .
Comfortable respiratory pattern .
Cardiovascular :
Regular rate and rhythm , no murmur .
2 plus femoral pulses were noted .
Abdomens oft with positive bowel sounds .
Genitourinary :
Infant was circumcised in the newborn nursery which was healing well .
Testes were descended bilaterally .
Extremities were pink and well perfused .
Neurologic :
Tone was appropriate for gestational age with equal strength , symmetric reflexes .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
Respiratory :
The infant was placed on a cardiopulmonary monitor upon admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit with pulse oximetry .
He was noted to have an episode of desaturation related to feeding with desaturations in the 70 percent .
This resolved spontaneously when the bottle was pulled from the baby 's mouth .
Jule remained in room air without any evidence of respiratory distress and was without any further dusky spells or pale episodes in the 48 hours prior to discharge .
Cardiovascular :
Renee remained cardiovascularly stable with AP s noted to be 120 to 130 s.
Blood pressure 84/43 with a mean of 59 .
Fluid , electrolytes and nutritions :
The baby had been breast feeding ad lib in the Newborn Nursery .
He continued to feed ad lib while a patient in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit .
He was fed with a bottle occasionally by his dad and had a vigorous suck and was noted to have some discoordination of his suck while breathing at the initial onset of feeding time .
This resolved with removal of the bottle from the baby 's mouth .
Breast feeding was limited to four to five minutes on each side per recommendation of neurology after their evaluation to try and minimize incidence of gastroesophageal reflux .
Weight at time of discharge is 3.13 kilograms .
Birth weight was 3.29 kilograms in the 75th percentile .
Head circumference was 34.5 cm , 75th percentile , and length was 50.7 cm , also the 75th percentile .
Gastrointestinal :
Baby was noted to have frequent spitting episodes .
This was minimized with limitation of volume at each feed with frequent feeding .
He had normal voiding and stooling patterns .
The baby demonstrated mild physiologic jaundice with a serum bilirubin obtained on day of life three which was 6.7 with a direct of 0.2 .
Mother 's blood type is O negative .
Infant 's blood type was O positive and Coombs was noted to be negative .
Hematologic :
In addition a complete blood count was obtained on admission with a white count of 10.1 with 43 polys and 0 bands .
Hematocrit was noted to 47.5 with platelets of 257,000 .
There were no blood products received during hospitalization .
Infectious disease :
A blood culture was obtained upon admission and Ampicillin and Gentamicin were given for 48 hours with blood cultures remaining sterile .
Antibiotics were discontinued on day of life three and infant has remained clinically well off antibiotics .
Neurology :
Neurology was consulted due to the concern for seizures in the setting of dusky episodes .
Neurology evaluated the baby and found the baby to have a normal neurological examination .
An EEG was performed .
The EEG showed transient sharp waves in the left front , left occipital and right parietal regions .
There was no electrographic evidence of seizure activity noted .
Sensory :
Hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses .
Baby passed in both ears on 09-23 .
Ophthalmology :
Ophthalmology was consulted due to the presence of a coloboma into the left CMED .
Ophthalmology noted that this left Martha coloboma was likely an isolated anomaly in the absence of other pathology .

Chief Complaint :
respiratory distress , hemoptysis transferred from OSH
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
debridement of mass from tracheal lumen by interventional pulmonary
History of Present Illness :
95 yo male with PMH large right thyroid cystic mass eroding into trachea , who presented to St. Anne 's Hospital 2018-04-22 with hemoptysis and respiratory distress , now diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma .
.
Pt reports that he noticed a right neck mass last October .
The mass grew larger , to the size of a baseball .
It appears that FNA was performed but was non-diagnostic ( probably because anaplastic tumors tend to be necrotic ) .
The mass appears to be cystic in nature and has been aspirated at least 3 times , which decrease in size each time .
Now size is 6.5cm*6.5cm .
Plan for surgery in Oct was deferred 04-05 syncope and pacer placement for SSS; again deferred 2 weeks ago 04-05 URI; was planned for surgery this Thurday .
.
Pt was o/w in his USOH until 2-3 weeks ago when he developed a URI with symptoms of dry cough; no fever , chills , sore throat , myalgias .
Pt was treated with 3 days of an antibiotics , followed by a 10 day course of levaquin ( completed 2 days PTA ) .
Per pt and son , no James pna .
2 days prior to admission , pt developed hemoptysis; states he coughed up 4 tsp of blood .
1 day PTA , pt developed stridorous breathing and respiratory distress .
Pt was initially seen at Lahey North , where he was given steroids , with improvement in respiratory status .
Pt was transferred to New England Baptist Hospital , where his surgeon is located .
There he was admitted to the CMED .
Thyroid cyst was aspirated with removal of 300cc of fluid . 
Pt was given racemic epinephrine and Decadron 10mg IV x1. CT neck showed tracheal mass per nursing s/o ( pt brought CT ) .
.
Pt now breathing more comfortably .
He has not had fever and night sweats but reports weakness and weight loss for several months recently .

Pertinent Results :
CT Neck - IMPRESSION :
1. 7-cm diameter right neck mass , with direct invasion of the subglottic , cervical and proximal thoracic trachea .
The mass is reportedly thyroid in origin .
Differential diagnosis includes primary head/neck cancer and lymphoma .
2. Left lobe thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous appearance .
3. Right upper paratracheal and prevascular lymphadenopathy as well as additional nodes in the right side of the neck .
Dedicated MR of the neck may be helpful for more complete assessment of the neck mass and lymphadenopathy if warranted clinically .
.
Pathology :
The tumor is composed of a relatively monotonous proliferation of spindle cells which grow in sheets with a prominent vascular pattern .
Immunostains for cytokeratin AE1/3 and CAM 5.2 , CD-68 , CD-79a , CD-138 , S-100 , LCA absorbed CEA , EMA , CD34 , CD31 , TTF-1 , actin , desmin , MNF-116 , calcitonin , and thyroglobulin are negative .
These results exclude both melanoma and hematopoietic neoplasms .
The differential diagnosis includes , but is not limited to , sarcoma , spindle cell carcinomas ( sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ) , and malignant salivary gland neoplasms .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt was transferred here for further mgmt of airway and large thyroid mass by our IP team .
IP found endotracheal obstructing tumor and extrinsic compression of the high trachea by thyroid mass .
After rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the intratracheal tumor component on 2018-04-24 , stat pathology showed anaplastic tumor .
He was tranferred to the CMED .
Subsequently extubated and his respiratory Sx are now improved .
Pt was seen by Rad Onc , who recommended transfer to the East Campus for XRT .
On the morning of possible radiation , patient and family met with interventional pulmonary team who explained that the most recent CT showed further invasion of the tumor into the trachea .
After a long discussion , patient and family asked to be made CMO .
Patient was started on morphine drip and palliative care team was consulted with recommendations to ensure comfort .
Mr . Davison died approximately 24 hours after decision to be CMO , on 2018-05-01 .

Chief Complaint :
large pericardial effusion , transfer from OSH
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Thoracentesis 2018-05-27
History of Present Illness :
82 F with h/o COPD , CAD , pafib and SSS s/p pacer on 05-08 for symptomatic pauses is transferred for large pericardial effusion ? needing drainage and CHF .
She was admitted to Cambridge Hospital 2018-05-24 with ARF ( Cr 3.5 up from 0.9 ) and SOB .
According to her guardian she was discharged to her NH for a few days after her pacer was placed 05-08 , which was complicated by a PTX requiring CT placement which had been d/c 'd in the hospital after resolution of her PTX .
She had some nausea / vomiting and generally was taking poor pos at her NH .
There had been some concern her nausea was due to her amiodarone which had been discontinued about 1 week ago .
She was then sent to Franklin Medical Center 05-24 with lethargy and n/v .
At Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center she was discovered to have ARF , a large pericardial effusion , and bilateral pleural effusions .
She was treated with IVF for her ARF .
She underwent a TTE at Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center today ( 05-26 ) showing mod-lg circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of RV diastolic collapse and no MV inflow evidence of tamponade , pacer wire located in RV apex .
There was still concern for her effusion contributing to her SOB at the OSH so she was transferred for drainage and treatment of CHF .
Today she only complains of some SOB , which she says remains largely unchanged over the past few days .
She denies any CP / cough / fever / abd pain / diarrhea / black or bloody stools / headache .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
82 y/o f w h/o afib , SSS s/p pacer 05-08 c/b PTX requiring CT , CAD , who was readmitted 05-24 with ARF and lethargy , found to have a large pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions , with echo showing no evidence of tamponade , who is transferred for possible pericardial effusion drainage and treatment of CHF , as well as drainage of bilateral pleural effusions .
She had a BNP of > 5000 on admission .
Since admission , she ruled out for MI by enzymes , and had a right sided thoracentesis which yielded transudative fluid .
WBC s since admission were as high as 14,000 but normalized .
She also had 2 echocardiograms which revealed persistent pericardial effusions .
She has been gently diuresed but has worsening ARF .
Her O2 requirement has increased despite diuresis .
She denies any CP / cough / fever , abdominal pain / diarrhea , black or bloody stools or headache .
Her urine output decreased to nearly zero .
In the setting of her ongoing pericardial effusion , she was transferred for closer observation to the CCU .
The CCU fellow and team declined to do pericardial drainage , as the pt was hemodynamically stable , without change in appearance of effusion by echo performed at bedside by cards fellow .
As she was felt by the CCU to be a poor candidate for right heart cath , was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 110 s- 120 s systolic and pulse 70 s- 80 s , she was called out of the CCU and back to the cardiac floor without intervention .
The procedure team was called to consider doing a left thoracentesis , but she was declined because it was felt that her effusions were transudative , secondary to CHF , and it was recommended to treat CHF .
The pt continued to have low urine output .
She was given a lasix drip IV upon call-out of the ICU , and additional boluses of IV lasix , 200 mg then 300 mg IV were given with a good response , however , she remained net positive fluid balance .
Renal consultants did not feel there was an emergent need for dialysis .
A nitro drip was started in an effort to decrease her preload and afterload .
On call out from the CCU , the pt was satting 93% on 4-5L NC , and through the following night , her oxygen requirement increased to NRB , wherein she was satting upper 80 s- low 90 s.
ABG that evening was 7.29/51/56 on 4L NC and early the next morning , was 7.25/62/64 on NRB .
A CXR was performed the evening of 5/16 , showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions , stable cardiomegaly and a possible RLL infiltrate .
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started .
She was afebrile .
The morning of 5/17 , her pulsus parodoxicus was 12 .
Because of her ABG , and declining clinical status , the CCU was notified for possible transfer .
The CMED CSRU Intern called the Murphy , Robert Leigh , to give her the update with regards to the pt 's deteriorating clinical status .
It was felt that given her age , multiple co-morbidities , that her prognosis was poor even prior to CCU admission , possible pericardial drainage or repeat thoracenteses .
Goals of care were clarified with her Murphy , Robert Sanchez .
Explained to Lewin that pt will likely need to be intubated , as she cannot lie flat , and most likely cannot undergo pericardial drainage , thoracentesis , or right heart cath with BiPAP ( which would have been the next measure after NRB , and prior to intubation ).
Explained that despite these invasive measures , she still has a very poor prognosis .
Odell stated she had been thinking about this all night of 2018-05-30 , and agreed that this is not what the pt would have wanted .
Odell does not believe the pt would want to be intubated , with central line , right heart cath , in the CCU .
She requested the patient be made Comfort Measures Only .
She was DNR/DNI on admission .
This was documented in the computer , confirmed with Cardiology attending and fellow , and conveyed to the CCU staff , who were informed she may need to go for transfer ( which was subsequently cancelled ).
The pt will be made comfortable , with goals of care shifted towards suppressing her air hunger and pain .
#. SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .
TTE revealed large pericardial effusion .
Pt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .
We continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .
Her 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .
Then , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.
She was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .
Her lasix gtt continued during this time .
Her oxygen sats did not improve .
She was then made CMO .
See above .
#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .
This has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .
It was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .
In the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .
#. CHF : normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction , ruled out for MI
- See course of diuresis above .
- We continued ASA / imdur / CCB / hold diovan until pt was made CMO .
#. Pleural effusions : Likely due to CHF although had some leukocytosis at admission to OSH .
Mary studies c/w transudate .
- After she was made CMO , the pt was started on Morphine gtt to maximize comfort and minimize air hunger .
#. Afib/SSS : She was A-paced , pacer placed 05-08 in DDDR mode , complicated by PTX requiring chest tube which resolved and tube was removed during admit for pacer , no evidence of PTX on most recent CXR .
Her pacer wires in correct position .
We continued amiodarone until pt was made CMO .
Anticoagulation has not been given this admission .
She was a poor anticoagulation candidate .
We started her on dilt for additional a fib control ( revert back to a fib on 05-29 ), which was stopped when the pt was made CMO .
#. Oliguric ARF : likely prerenal due to n/v poor po intake and poor forward flow , However , need to continue diuresis .
Her urine lytes consistent with ATN , FENA 4% .
Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis .
Renal consultants did not feel that there was an indication for urgent hemodialysis .
She continued to put out low amounts of urine throughout the admission , despite aggressive diuresis with IV lasix gtt and boluses .
See above .
#. ID : initially had leukocytosis at admission , with chest CT showing possible underlying consolidations vs. atelectasis , levoflox started 05-24 and subsequently stopped ( no consolidations on CXR and afebrile ).
U/A on 05-27 c/w UTI .
Pt now on IV Ceftriaxone ( was on levoflox since 05-24 however UA now floridly positive ( more so than UA at OSH ) so felt possibly levo-resistant .
Pt started on CTX 05-27 .
She was empirically started on vanco/zosyn for empiric hosp acquired pna coverage
- possible opacity on CXR - along w/ leukocytosis .
#. Anemia : Unclear source .
She was guiaic negative .
- no transfusions , CMO/DNR/DNI

** FINAL REPORT 2018-08-06 **
HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST ( Final 2018-08-06 ) :
NEGATIVE BY EIA .
( Reference Range-Negative ) .
GI bleed study - IMPRESSION :
Active radiotracer activity in the right lower quadrant in a serpingneous f fashion suggestive of distal small bowel .
EGD - Impression :
Angioectasias in the fundus
Angioectasias in the antrum
Angioectasias in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum
Angioectasia in the duodenum
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum
Recommendations :
No site of active bleeding was seen .
The fundal AVMs are a potential site of bleeding although do not explain the extent of bleeding .
Consider endoscopic argon plasma therapy
Proceed with colonoscopy .
Colonoscopy -
Impression :
Blood in the colon
Grade 1 external hemorrhoids
Angioectasia in the colon
Diverticulosis of the colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Brief Hospital Course :
Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding - the bleeding was likely from an AVM .
EGD , colonoscopy and tagged scan results as above .
eventhough uptake was noted in the rt LQ , no clear site of bleeding was noticed on colonoscopy .
hence , no intervention was performed .
she was transfused with 5 units of PRBC in the ICU andsent to the Lahey Clinic - North Shore .
Her hematocrit remained stable for 4 days prior to discharge .
No further bleeding noted .
GI consult team followed pt in hospital .
On discussion with Dr Leigh and Dr White from GI - they recommended that she follow with Dr. Taylor for consideration of argon photocoagulation as out-patient .
Given the innumerable number of AVM 's , it is diffcult to assess which the culprit lesion is and GI may start APL from the fundus of stomach .
Patient to get CBC checked with PCP this week as below .
ASA was held and may be restarted if Hct stable in clinic at the PCP 's discretion .
Chronic thrombocytopenia was noted , however the patient did not require platelet transfusions .
Has a h/o HIT .
The metoprolol was held during acute bleeding phase and restarted prior to discharge as her BP stabilized .
Other medical problems stable .
Dialysis was continued 3 / week .
I personally talked with Dr Pannell at the time of discharge to update him with the hospital events .

Brief Hospital Course :
This patient was admitted on 08-04 after a recent discharge from the hospital for sudden onset of left sided abdominal pain .
In the emergency room , his ultrasound showed mild hydronephrosis with new perinephric fluid surrounding the transplant kidney and hence , underwent a CT scan of his abdomen / pelvis which showed a large left-sided of retroperitoneal hemorrhage extending down to the level of the renal transplant possibly related to recent transplant biopsy .
Renal transplant medicine and transplant surgery were made aware and the pt was admitted to transplant
CMED and to the ICU .

By 08-07 , it was thought there was improvement of his labs .
In the am of 6/13 , he was given 1 unit pRBC for a Hct of 21.8 .
His Hct was stable on 08-09 at 24.4 ; he had plasmapheresis on 08-09 ( followed by 10 mg IVIG ).
He was transfered to the floor on 08-09 .
On 08-10 , his am Hct was 21.9 , hence , he received 1 unit pRBC .
On 08-10 class I and II antibody levels were sent .
He had plasmapheresis on 08-11 , followed by 10 mg IVIG .
This was repeated on 08-13 .

Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was taken to the operating room on 2018-12-04 for TVH , sacrospinous fixation , SPARC , anterior and posterior repair with mesh , cystoscopy; for pelvic organ prolapse .
There were no intraoperative complications and the surgical field was hemostatic at the conclusion of the case ( see operative report for full description ) .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable in the PACU and admitted to the CMED CCU floor for routine care .
At 1645 12-04 , the patient was noted to be hypotensive to 70/40
HR 84 with symptoms of lightheadedness while lying supine .
There was no active bleeding noted at the surgical site on examination .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 31.2 .
The patient was re-evalutated at 2000 and was found to be tacchycardic to 115 with BP 104/50 using a manual cuff .
Urine output during the prior two hours had been 50cc and 24cc .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 19.5 .
The clinical picture was concerning for a post-operative hematoma .
The ICU was alerted to the patient 's disposition and the operating room was activated for urgent re-exploration .
The patient was taken to the OR on POD#0 for re-exploration with incision at 2243 .
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitonium and approximately 1 L of blood was evacuated .
There was approximately 500cc of retroperitoneal clot .
Despite laparotomy and re-exploration through the vaginal cuff , no source for the bleeding could be found .
At the conclusion of the case , the patient continued to bleed , allbeit at a less brisk pace .
The endotracheal tube was left in place .
Intraoperatively , the patient recieved 5u PRBC .
IR was consulted to identify the bleeding vessel with angiography , then perform embolization .
Tagged cell and angiographic studies performed immediately after re-exploration on 12-05 did not indetify active bleeding and no emobolization was indicated .
THe patient was stable and remained intubated .
The patient was admitted to the ICU for further care .
The patient 's ICU course was uneventful .
There was no evidence of continued bleeding and her HCT remained stable around 30 .

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Intubation for airway protection tunneled line change over wire 2019-01-08
History of Present Illness :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
Pt was recently admitted to The Hospital for Orthopedics from 12-07 thorugh 12-14 with hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis at HD.
However , a septic component to the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool .
Pt was then discharged to Arbour-Fuller Hospital Senior Life where she was in her normal state of health until three days ago .
Her son reports that she then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago which were treated with tylenol .
Then , this morning she developed fatigue and did not eat well .
He son also notes that she appeared to be working hard to breath .
She was found to be febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin .
Pt was then sent to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
Per notes , pt denied SOB , CP , and abdominal pain prior to intubation .
She did complain of a left frontal headache .
In the Juan , the pt 's VS were singificant for a fever of 103.8 , tachycardia in the 130s-150s , and initial hypertensive in the 140s .
Her oxygen saturation was 96% on RA but she was tachypneic to 31 .
She was obtunded and was thus intubated for airway protection .
Post-intubation , the pt 's BP acutely dropped to 58/19 in the setting of propofol .
When this medication was discontinued , her BP came back up to the 70s-90s / 30s-50s .
Pt was then initiated on the sepsis protocol .
In the Juan , she received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl , and cefepime ( 2 gm ).
She received a total of 4 liters of NS then was started on levophed for continued hypotension .
Pt is now transferred to the FICU for further care .
Per pt 's son , she is bedbound at baseline due to her multiple LE femur fractures .
Past Medical History :
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
2. Diabetic nephropathy resulting in ESRD for which she is on HD .
Pt was due for HD but missed it secondary to her illness .
She normally receives HD on Mon , Wed , and Fri .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
1. Sepsis / ID- Started on sepsis protocol .
Unclear etiology headache over the three days prior to admission in association with fever was concerning for a CNS etiology .
Covered broadly with vancomycin , flagyl , and cefipime .
Given stress dose steroids empirically and Sanchez stim showed cortisol of 9.3 --> 10.3 therefore steroids continued .
CXR , LP , UA and abdominal CT showed no sign of infection .
PICC line was removed empirically .
Tip could not be cultured due to contamination .
Cultures drawn off the HD cath are negative to date .
Patient 's LE ulcers appear chronic and do not appear to be the source of infection .
Her left knee is slightly erythematous compared to the right but not impressive .
Joint is mobile .
Nasal washings for influenza were negative ; culture pending .
Patient improved over the next few days .
Steroids were discontinued .
On 12-18 flagyl and cefepime were discontinued as all culture data negative to date .
Plan to continue vancomycin for 08-19 day course to treat empiric line infection .
Urine culture came back positive for VRE , however , since patient improved without treatement ( ie Linezolid ) initially .
After transfer to the floor when she was stable .
On the floor the Vancomycin was discontinued as the catheter tip culture was negative .
ID was consulted who suggested broad spectrum antibiotics if she were to spike .
When pt spiked a temperature and became hypotensive she was started on Linezolid was started for presumed VRE infection in the urine .
She will be treated for total 14 day course .
She was also started on fluconazole for yeast in the urine , to be treated with fluconazole for total 7 days .
She was given Flagyl for presumed C. Diff. Colitis , however this was stopped when C. Diff B toxin came back negative on 2019-01-10 .
The tunneled catheter line was changed over a wire and the tip was also negative .
2. Respiratory - Intubated for airway protection due to change in mental status .
Extubated 12-28 with no incident .
3. ECG changes - Patient had an episode of chest pain during her hospital stay that was both right and left sided with no radiation and no associated symptoms .
ECG showed new diffuse TWI in all leads .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were normal .
Echo was obtained which showed WMA and EF of 35-40% .
Pt was note started on ASA as she does not tolerate this well , BB was also not started given SBPs in the 110s .
Statin was also deffered .
She may be started on ASA , BB , statin by PCP as Stephen .
4. Shoulder fracture - Patient is s/p a left hip fracture ( decision not to operate ) and a left shoulder fracture with hemiarthroplasty 11-14 .
Patient was found to have a new humerus fracture distal to the hardware on film this admission .
Assumed to be secondary to trauma when moving patient into ambulance .
CMED service was consulted and recommended wtd woulnd care and sling at all times .
Wound care should be continued as described after discharge .
5. Type 2 DM - Patient was initially covered with an insulin drip while septic and then transitioned back to insulin sliding scale .
6. ESRD on HD - Pt has ESRD secondary to her DM and is on HD .
She was dialysed but was slightly limited by hypotension .
Dialyzed 12-28 with plan to dialyze again 12-31 .
Her dialysis was managed by renal service in house .
7. PE ( 11-14 )- On heparin drip .
Restared coumadin on 12-29 .
Heparin discontinued on 01-01 when INR was 2.0 .
Coumadin was stopped and she received fFP for tunneled line change over a wire .
Coumadin was restarted at a dose of 2 mg qhs .
This should be titrated after discharge for INR goal of 2-3 .
8. PVD :
Dry gangrene of toes bilaterally w/ necrosis of the heels and posterior calf .
Continue to monitor for sign of infection .
On vit C. and zinc as well to aid w/ wound healing .
Wound care consult given anasarca to prevent decub .
9. Left UE markedly more edematous than right UE , this could be from fracture , or there could be a clot , an abscess in the area also a possiblity .
Ultrasound without clot .
Continue elevation and tight dressing to LUE >
10. Access - Left IJ placed 12-26 in Juan was discontinued during the hospitilization .
Right dialysis catheter ( 2018-11-05 ) was changed over a wire 2019-01-08 .
PICC line placed 2019-01-08 , this should be discontinued immediately after pt finishes the linezolid course .
11. Code status - Initially full code then made DNR / DNI after family meeting on 02-27 .
Made full code again on 12-30 after family meeting with son .

01-11 MRI Left Knee w/o Contrast
1. Bucket handle medial meniscal tear with flipped fragment in the intercondylar notch .
Complex tear involving the posterior Ellison and body .
2. Moderate knee joint effusion with possible ganglion cyst at the insertion of the PCL .
3. Discoid lateral meniscus .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Anders was admitted for anticoagulation and hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of saddle pulmonary embolus and left knee injury .
#. PE :
Given no other risk factors or likely causes , the most likely etiology for his embolus is DVT from the left leg .
He has no known clotting disorder but did have trauma to leg prompting immobility and stasis .
He remained hemodynmically stable throughout his hospitalization and did not have an oxygen requirement upon discharge .
Given no evidence of hemodynamic instability , lysis was not required .
He was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin .
He will need to follow up with hematology for an outpatient thrombophilia work-up ( not done as inpatient as results would not change acute management of PE ).
He will also require close follow up with his primary care provider for coumadin management .
Duration of his coumadin therapy to be determined by hematology , but likely to be at least 6 months in duration .
#. Syncope :
In setting of PE .
Remainder of his cardiac workup was negative .
He did have a small troponin leak , felt to be related to right heart strain in the setting of P-pulmonale related to clot burden .
His tronponin quickly trended down and he did not have EKG evidence of ischemia .
An ECHO did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities related to ischemia .
#. Hematocrit :
Dropped from 42.7 to 36 in setting of anticoagulation for saddle PE and IV fluids .
No active bleeding noted .
Pt asymptomatic .
#. L knee injury :
Given his history and physical exam , Mr. Anders presented with an injury most consistent with meniscal tear .
In order to facilitate therapy and to promote mobility , an MRI of the knee was done .
He was seen by physical therapy and will need to follow up with orthopaedics upon discharge for repeat evaluation .

History of Present Illness :
This is a 37 y/o male patient with PMH Type I DM , HTN , gastroparesis , ESRD on HD ( last in 12/26 per patient ) who presents to CMED CCU with hypertensive urgency unable from the Larry .
The patient early this morning to the Ruthie with his usual nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and was found to be hypertensive to 256/110 , HR 102 , T 99.2 , RR 22 , 92% RA .
History is difficult to obtain from patient d/t somnolence and lack of desire to participate in interview , but per Frank note he was diaphoretic and ' writing in pain ', vomiting clear substance .
He was given ativan a total of 4 mg of ativan , 6 mg of dilaudid , labetolol 20 mg IV x 1 and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 1 without good response ( 200/99 ).
He recieved 2L NS and was started on labetolol gtt and BP decreased to 161/79 .
Tranferred to CMED CCU for further management while on labetolol gtt .
Of note , the patient is admitted to hospital 3 times every month for similar complaints with last admission 1/20-2/1/07 .
At that time BP was attributed to abdominal pain and inability to take PO meds d/t nausea / vomiting .
Also had labile blood sugars with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia , and Strickland recommended sugars in the range of 150-200 .
He eloped prior to formal discharge when his FS was found to be critically high - recommended to patient that he stay for repeat , but left AMA without signing any forms .
Upon transfer to the CMED CCU the patient appears somewhat uncomfortable , reporting nausea and abdominal pain , but when questioned he was unable / unwilling to participate in HPI or exam d/t sleepiness .
He denied CP , SOB , HA , vision changes , neck stiffness , dysuria , or other symptoms .
In the CMED CCU he became hypotensive to SBP 80 s.
Labetalol was stopped and he received a 500 cc fluid bolus and his blood pressure rose to SBP 90 s.
Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered , but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection ; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site .
He received a partial HD session , limited by hypotension .
Over night , his blood pressure trended up to 130 s systolic .
He was restarted on his home blood pressure regimen .
Renal consult team saw him 2019-01-20 and plan to next dialyze him on 2019-01-21 .
He was to be called out to the medical floor on 2019-01-20 but became somnolent after receiving pain and anti-nausea meds , so he stayed in the ICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status , which spontaneously improved .
His blood sugar at 10 pm was low at 22 and he was disoriented , which resolved with two glasses of juice ; he did not receive his standing dose of NPH that evening .
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters , so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started .
He was then called out to the medical floor on 01-21 .

Brief Hospital Course :
Pt is a 78 yo male with atrial fibrillation , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 transferred from the CMED CCU s/p intervention for cholangitis .
1) Acute cholangitis : Pt was admitted to the ICU , intubated , and ERCP performed , likely stone obstructing CBD .
Stent was placed and patient was treated with antibiotics ( Zosyn - > Ciprofloxacin ).
Per ERCP fellow , plan is for patient to return in four weeks to see Dr. Suzanne Davis , at which time he will likely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone .
If this is still problematic , pt may also need a sphincterotomy .
Dr.Demby secretary will contact patient at home the week after discharge to schedule this for the end of January .
Pt is to continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course .
2) Mechanical mitral valve : Anticoagulation was reversed for ERCP .
After this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip .
INR was 1.9 on discharge .
He was given sc lovenox x 1 and will continue this the day after discharge bid for one day .
VNA will check his INR at home and page his PCP with the results .
3) Atrial fibrillation : Rate controlled and on warfarin .
While in the hospital he had several episodes of pauses , none longer than 2.5 seconds .
His digoxin was held and his metoprolol was titrated down from his home dose .
Once the digoxin was no longer having effect , metoprolol was titrated back to home dose .
4) CHF : Pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course , CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema .
He was diuresed with lasix with good effect .
Volume overload likely ocurred in the setting of IV fluids given in the ICU .
Did not require lasix on discharge .
5) E. coli bacteremia / sepsis : Source of acute cholangitis as above .
Pt required 3 day stay in the surgical ICU and intubation as above .
6) Intubation : Pt was 97% on room air on arrival to Cindy , developed rapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated , but after that period of time required oxygen , presumably for pulmonary edema .
In the Lori pt was given 3L NS as well as 1 unit of FFP , and oxygen requirements contimued to climb .
In the CMED CCU pt was intubated for ERCP procedure .
He was extubated the next morning .
Medications on Admission :
Lisinopril 2.5 qday , Buspiron 20 mg po qday , Digoxin , Doxasozin 8 mg qhs , Glyburide 2.5 mg qday , metoprolol bid , atorvastatin 20 mg qday , warfarin 5 mg qday

Chief Complaint : progressing slowing of mentation and gait difficulties since a week ; evaluation for ICH
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
None
History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 83 yo R-handed man with a history of multiple intracranial hemorrhages during the last few years , pacemaker , hyperlipidemia , arrhythmia who now presents with gradual decline in gait and slowing of mentation over the last week .
The patient had a fall about ten days ago , when he was walking the dog .
The leash got wrapped around his legs .
According to his wife he had a small abrasion on the top of his head , but nothing major .
He did not complain about a headache .
He was at baseline with respect to his gait ( at baseline unsteady , though he refuses to walk with a walker ) and his mentation ( at baseline difficulties with memory since months ; keeps forgetting appointments ).
Then about a week ago , the patient and his wife noted that his gait became even more unsteady , though he did not fall .
He also had difficulties navigating through his apartment , having difficulties finding the fridge for example .
They were concerned that the fall might have caused another bleed , as had happened in the past , and this prompted them to come to the Deanna .
No headache , neckpain , nausea , vomiting or focal weakness / numbness .
Review of systems : denies any fever , chills , weight loss , visual changes , hearing changes , dysphagia , tingling , numbness , bowel-bladder dysfunction , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , dysuria , hematuria , or bright red blood per rectum .
His legs have been feeling weaker , bilaterally since the last week .

1. Previous interventricular hemorrhages :
06-30 resolved as of repeat head CT one month later , no residual deficits; 03-03 : ICH in 3rd , 4th , and L-lat ventricle ; no aneurysm ; 07-01 : ICH in R-temporal lobe ; question of underlying mass at that time per contrast CT ; decided to follow up with serial scans rather than to biopsy
2. pacemaker placement for arrhythmia , Afibb ; during last hospitalization episodes of NSVT
3. history of slowness of gait , ? parkinsons ? and possibly dementia followed by Dr. Ahern ( Laurence Eichorn ).
Sinemet was stopped during last admission 06-30 as he was thought to NOT have PD .

CT BRAIN ( INITIAL )
FINDINGS :
There is a 41 x 23 mm area of hyperdensity within the right frontal lobe , with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema
( series 2 , image 23 ) , compatible with acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
The chronic encephalomalacic changes at the adjacent right frontal lobe and the right parietal / occipital region remain stable in appearance .
There is mild mass effect upon the anterior Mims of the right lateral ventricle .
No further intraaxial or extraaxial fluid collections or hematoma are identified .
There is no displacement of the normally midline structures , hydrocephalus , or effacement of the basal cisterns at present .
Review of bone windows demonstrates no skull bulge or skull base fracture .
There is an air / fluid level within the right maxillary sinus - ? acute sinusitis , but acute blood cannot be excluded , in the setting of acute trauma .
CONCLUSION :
41 x 23 mm acute intraparenchymal hematoma at the right frontal lobe , causing mild mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle , suspicious of hemorrhage secondary to congophilic angiopathy in this age group .
Chronic encephalomalacic changes at the right frontal lobe and right parietal / occipital region are unchanged in appearance since 2018-11-27 .
REPEAT HEAD CT 03-30 : no significant change from above .
EKG :
Atrial pacing .
Since the previous tracing of 2018-03-15 atrial pacing is a new finding .
The electrocardiogram is otherwise , unchanged and continues to Weymouth voltage in the limb leads and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .

Brief Hospital Course :
The patient is a 83 yo man with a history of past intracranial hemorrhages ( most recent 07-01 with R-frontal hemorrhage ) who presented with gradually slowing of mentation and increased gait instability since one week .
On initial exam the patient was not oriented to time , seemed somewhat slow , and had difficulties generating a list of animals .
His cranial nerves and strength were full , and the sensory exam showed mildly decreased vibration and proprioception in both LE , suggesting peripheral neuropathy .
A CT was performed in the Deanna that showed a new significant R-frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the same location as the prior bleed .
The patient was seen by both neurology and neurosurgery , and the two teams agreed that the etiology seemed to be related to underlying amyloidosis .
During the last admission the question of a mass underlying a hemorrhage in the R-frontal region was raised .
The location of the hemorrhage was not felt to be typical for hypertensive bleed ( cortical ) and it was felt to be unlikely that the recent fall was related to the bleed .
The patient could not undergo an MRI due to his pacer .
He was admitted to the neurology ICU for closer monitoring and was stable overnight - BP was initially elevated and required a labetalol drip for < 24 hours , then stabilized .
The goal SBP of < 150 was achieved .
Coags and UA were checked and were normal .
For the question of seizure activity associated with a cortical bleed , he was started prophylactically on Keppra ( given questionable allergy to dilantin ) , at 500 mg bid ; no seizure activity was seen .
This medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .
Head CT repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .
The plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .
Cardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .
He could not get an MRI due to his pacemaker .
There were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .
Pulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .
Endocrinologically , BG was monitored to improve outcome in ICU setting though he had no history of DM .
Of note , Hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( "" borderline DM "" ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .
Ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , VD boots and PUD prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .
Walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .
PT was asked to see him for this gait problem .
Brandon felt well and was seen by PT who suggested a rehab/Hahnemann Hospital ( Worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .
Follow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) .

Chief Complaint :
Shortness of breath , fever
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
None
History of Present Illness :
Mr. Mcelveen is a 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC status post left radical nephrectomy in 2018-03-21 , status post Avastin and sorafenib , most recently on Sutent monotherapy since 2018-12-21 , with mild renal insufficiency , who presented from home on 2019-06-14 with shortness of breath and fever .
Of note , he was hospitalized at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 9/25-10/6 with chest pain , at which time he reportedly had cardiac enzymes , an echocardiogram and a pharmacological stress test performed .
It is unclear from history what these studies revealed .
He reports that he felt fatigued during the week prior to the current admission .
On the day of admission , he felt "" congested "" in his chest , and had a new fever .

Relevant Imaging :
1) Bilateral LE doppler ( 06-14 ): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities bilaterally .
2) Cxray ( 06-14 ): New bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusion .
The lung volumes are slightly increased .
There is no pneumothorax identified .
3) CT Torso ( 06-17 ):
1. Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette .
Together with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions , this indicates cardiac insufficiency ( or alternatively volume overload ) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation .
2. Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis .
Superimposed infectious consolidation is likely .
3. Interval development of tree-in-Eric nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung , concerning for an infectious process .
The differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral , fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections .
Drug toxicity would be a consideration , although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings .
4. New jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding , most likely reflecting an infectious etiology .
5. Overall stability in metastatic burden .
4) ECHO ( 06-18 ): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function .
Mild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation .
Small ( 0.6 cm ) circumferential pericardial effusion , largest around the left atrium .
5) L femur xray ( 06-18 ): Predominantly sclerotic lesion with interval periosteal new bone formation involving the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions .
No displaced fracture is demonstrated .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Mcelveen 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on Sutent since 2018-12-21 , admitted with fever , hypoxemia , and bibasilar pneumonia .
1) Bibasilar pneumonia : Patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia .
He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone , Levaquin , and Flagyl in the ICU but then changed to 
Azithromycin & CTX at time of transfer to the oncology service .
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities , suggestive of an underlying infectious process .
ECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction .
His respiratory status improved slowly , oxygen was weaned off , and he was discharged on course of Levaquin .
2) Metastatic RCC : Sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection .
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden .
Patient was also found to have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement 
therapy .
He will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient .
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck .
He underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture .
No limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status .
Patient was instructed to restart Sutent next Monday .
3) Renal insufficiency : Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge .
Likely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration .

She arrived at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital on 07-01 for 1 day of nausea and vomiting and was found to be febrile to 99 at that time .
She was admitted for likely gastroparesis and eventually had a complete fever work-up that included a negative chest x-ray , blood cultures , and urine culture .
She was discharged on 07-02 and represented that day with continued nause , vomiting , and fever .
She was readmitted and had a complete febrile work-up that included CT abdomene / pelvis , chest x-ray , blood culture 's , urine cultures , all of which were unremarkable .
She was intubated on 07-03 for progressive respiratory failure .
Workup continued to be negative .
Extubation was attempted on 07-14 , but she was re-intubated due to inspiratory stridor .
A CT neck showed soft tissue swelling obliterating the airway surrounding the ETT tube .
She was transferred to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital for further management .

Imaging :
1. Nexk CT :
Increased soft tissues within the pharynx .
This may be secondary to soft tissue swelling as indicated in the patient 's history , and some may be secondary to secretions above the ETT balloon .
No retropharyngeal fluid is identified .
Dependent atelectasis is present within the visualized portions of the lung apices .
2. Chest CT :
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations mostly in dependent portion , with small pleural effusion and diffuse ground-glass opacity in bilateral upper and lower lobes , consistent with ARDS with pulmonary edema given the history .
Ground-glass opacity is somewhat more prominent in right upper lobe , and superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded .
Brief Hospital Course :
This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic respiratory failure .
1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure :
She arrived intubated and sedated from Esteban Hospital .
On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar and bibasilar opacities , which appeared conistent with pulmonary edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia .
There was no evidence of ARDS .
She was known to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum at the outside hospital .
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA .
She was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia .
A CT scan was performed on 07-17 to evaluate the soft tissue swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital .
The CT showed increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be secondary to prolonged intubation / trauma .
She was treated with steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital , and these were continued .
It was decided that patient should receive one more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy .
She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to delay extubating the patient until the morning of 6/2 .
Overnight , the patient became hypoxic , dropping to the 80 's .
A chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high in the trachea .
The cuff was deflated and the patient was extubated .
She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask and her sats immediately improved .
She was weaned down until she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by nasal cannuala .
As she was doing well without evidence of stridor , the steroids were stopped .
She did well and was weaned from supplemental oxygen .
At the time of discharge , she was oxygenating well on room air .
She Will need to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on 2019-07-30 .
2. Enterobacter bacteremia :
She was initially covered broadly with vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , and falgyl .
She had positive blood cultures at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for gram negative rods .
Subsequently , zosyn was added .
The cultures grew out enterobacter cloacae .
It was unclear the source of her bacteremia .
Her stool cultures were negative .
Her central line was removed and the tip was culture negative .
She was transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia .
She had no positive cultures during this admission .
Once she was more stable , an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess .
This study was negative .
However , the study was limited due to inadequate po contrast intake by the patient ; it did show a question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel .
This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po 's .
She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her bacteremia on 2019-07-30 .
3. Diabetes type I :
She was intially maintained on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
She was followed by Albano during the admission .
She was initially maintained on D5W , which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip .
Once she began to take PO 's , the insulin drip was stopped and patient was started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale .
While her po intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV dextrose to suppress ketosis .
While she was on the IV dextrose , she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control .
As she starting taking some foods , her glargine was decrease .
At the time of discharge her glargine was 10 .
Her blood glucose were under good control .

Service :
Neonatology
HISTORY :
Baby Barbara Stead is a term infant admitted with increasing head circumference and bruising .
He was born to a 31-year-old G1 P0 now 1 mother with unremarkable prenatal screens as follows :
O positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive , rubella immune
PREGNANCY HISTORY :
Estimated date of delivery was 2012-05-14 for estimated gestational age of 39-1/7 weeks .
Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios with an AFI of 3.5 and by multiple evaluations for decreased fetal movement .
There was spontaneous onset of labor progressing through vacuum assisted vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia .
clear amniotic fluid , no antepartum maternal fever or fetal tachycardia , no antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis .
Baby was vigorous at delivery , was bulb suction , dried , and had free flow oxygen administered briefly .
Apgars were nine and nine .
In the Newborn Nursery , he initially had a caput which increased in the amount of swelling and bruising in the subsequent 24 hours .
He was then referred to the CMED CCU for assessment and management of the increased bleeding .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE CMED CCU :
Birth weight was 3850 grams .
Head circumference was 41 cm .
HEENT was significant for swelling of the scalp tissue in generalized distribution with ecchymosis extending from the occiput to the posterior auricular area and dorsal aspect of the neck to the mid cervical level .
Ears were displaced forward .
Eyes were normal .
Neck and mouth were normal .
No nasal flaring .
Chest :
No retractions , good breath sounds bilaterally , no crackles .
Cardiovascular :
Regular , rate , and rhythm .
Femoral pulses normal , S1 , S2 were normal .
There was a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur in the upper left sternal border without radiation .
Abdomen was soft , nontender , no organomegaly , no masses .
Bowel sounds are active and patent .
CNS active , responsive to stimulation .
Pupils are reactive to light .
Tone is normal , moving all limbs symmetrically , irritable with palpation of the scalp .
Suck , root , gag , grasp , and morrow were normal .
Skin :
Pale as above , nonicteric .
Musculoskeletal :
Normal spine , hip , clavicles , small mass at the site of previous right quadriceps intramuscular injection .
An initial head CT scan had revealed extracranial soft tissue swelling most prominently at the right frontal-parietal-occipital area extending to the left and to the upper cervical region .
Ventricles were symmetrical and not compressed .
No gross intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
But upon further radiology attending Stoughton , there was a small bilateral occipital subdural hemorrhage noted .
The initial hematocrit was 21.2 , platelets 186 .
PT was 14.6 , PTT 77 with an INR of 1.4 .
Fibrinogen was 192 .
D-dimer was negative .
ASSESSMENT :
This is a term infant with significant subgaleal hematoma with apparent extension over the past six hours .
There was also elevation of the PTT suggesting possible inborn coagulopathy .
There is also critical anemia secondary to the subgaleal hemorrhage .
He was admitted to the CMED CCU for further management .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
1. Respiratory :
Patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95% .
No apnea or bradycardia .
2. Cardiovascular :
There was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
3. FEN :
Patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized .
He has been taking breast milk or Enfamil 20 po adlib .
His admission weight was 3850 grams .
His weight on discharge was 4055 .
4. GI :
Given the significant amount of bleeding , baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy .
His bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued .
5. Hematology :
Given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed , coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated PTT level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
He was started on a 50 units / kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units / kg / day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 .
Subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units / kg and increased factor 8 infusion rate to 65 units / kg / day .
As of 05-17 , he was switched over to bolus infusion in preparation of continued home factor 8 administration .
His peak level after a bolus of 75 units / kg of factor 8 was 131 .
A trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 .
He will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage , and will be followed by Hematology visiting nurse Michael Edwards level checks at home .
Currently , the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular Broviac which was placed on 05-15 for administration of factor .
His last PTT on 05-16 was 68.3 .
The last hematocrit was on 05-16 of 54.5 .
6. Neurology :
Baby Mary Stead initially presented with significant subgaleal bleed as well as a small subdural hemorrhage .
A repeat head CT scan on 05-15 had shown the resolution of the subdural hematoma and significant improvement of the subgaleal bleed .
His head ultrasound on 05-14 reveals no interventricular hemorrhage .
He had remained neurologically stable .
His head circumference on 05-18 was 36.5 cm with a maximum head circumference on
admission of 40.5 cm .
7. Social :
Both parents are very involved in the care of Baby Norman Stead .
They have been informed up to date on his needs , discharge from the hospital .
Teaching has been completed on the care of the Boviak as well as administration of factor 8 .
8. Sensory :
Audiology :
Hearing screen was performed automated auditory brain stem responses and Baby David Stead
passed bilaterally .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Baby Julian Stead had been stable with improvement of the subgaleal bleed and good peak and trough factor 8 levels after the bolus infusion .

He refused an NG lavage .
Although an initial DRE showed only clot , he later passed a large , bloody bowel movement , and his bp nadired to the low 90's but rested there only transiently and easily rebounded to the 130's-140's with fluid ; he then went to angiography for a tagged RBC scan where they found and embolized two vessels to the sigmoid colon .
His HCT had dropped from 36.7 to 30.8 despite 2U PRBC and 3 U FFP .
Is called out of the FICU as has been been HD and stable HCT .
Currently denies CP , SOB , abd pain or continued BRBPR .

GI BLEEDING STUDY
2012-10-31
IMPRESSION : Increased tracer activity demonstrated within the left lower quadrant , most likely sigmoid colonic loops of bowel , consistent with active bleeding .
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST
2012-10-31 3:27 PM
IMPRESSION :
1. No evidence of colitis or other bowel pathology present to explain the patient 's bright red blood per rectum .
2. Stable appearance of left adrenal fat-containing lesion consistent with a myelolipoma .
3. Stable appearance of hypodense lesion within the caudate lobe of the liver , too small to fully characterize .
4. Subcentimeter attenuation lesion within the lower pole of the right kidney , too small to characterize .
5. 3-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lower lobe . 
If the patient does not have a history of a primary malignancy , followup CT of the chest in 1 year is recommended to evaluate for stability of this finding .
Brief Hospital Course :
Initial A/P :
71 y/o male with dm2 , cad , chf , uc presents with one week of lower abdominal pain and 2 episodes of brpbr on the day of admission .
# BRBPR -- The patient was in the intensive care unit given his lower GI bleed .
An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the Minnie supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized .
The patient was transfused from a Hct 29 to 34 on the day of discharge .
His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge .
- The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday , 11-02 , which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding .
Given this , it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding .
- The patient had a colonoscopy on Monday 11-05 but unfortunately , was unable to complete the study as his bowel 
prep was inadequate .
Therefore , he had a repeat colonoscopy on 11-06 which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis , no polyps , w/ 8 mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon .
- Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results .
# Ulcerative colitis -- The patient 's Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI .
# CAD/CHF - The patient was restarted on his home regimen prior to discharge as it was held temporarily given his acute GI bleed .
The exception is that per his PCP , Jason aspirin will be held for 2 weeks given that he was restarted on coumadin with 
his risk of bleeding .
# DM-2 -- The patient was maintained on his home insulin regimen .
# h/o DVT/PE :
Coumadin was initially held .
It was unclear at first as to why the patient required life-long anticoagulation .
After discussing this with his PCP , Leon was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation .
His goal INR should be 1.6-2.0 . If bleeding continues to occur , consider V. Winchester filter .

BLUE GENERAL SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Gonzalez is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism , iron-deficiency anemia , osteoporosis , increased cholesterol , peptic ulcer disease , chronic constipation , and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder .
At the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back .
She was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss , melena , or bright red blood per rectum .
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder .
It also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct .
Incidentally , it also showed diverticulosis .
A HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of
cystic duct obstruction .
The first imaging study that was done at Hahnemann General Hospital was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis .
A differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis .
In addition, also the MRCP showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder .
Of note , at the outside hospital , an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed .
The colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied .
This biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma .
The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was scheduled for an operative date on 2014-07-29 and over the next few days she was
given a low-residual diet .
She had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed , she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an
exploratory laparotomy on Tuesday , 2014-07-29 .
On the morning of 2014-07-29 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy , partial hepatectomy , partial lymph node dissection , a colocolostomy , partial colectomy , and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery .
Briefly , the surgery on 2014-07-29 revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery .
In addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube , two Belmont-Gardner drains were placed .
The patient 's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter .
However , the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day .
In addition , the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells .
In addition , on postoperative day number two , the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a Dilaudid PCA machine .
On postoperative day number two , interestingly , the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology .
The patient 's postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia .
On postoperative day number two , an Oncology consult with Dr. Natalie Mcalister was obtained and
follow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient .
Following that , the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus .
Her bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six .
The patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake .
On postoperative day number seven , the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds .
She was started on p.o. medicines and her first Belmont-Gardner drain was pulled due to scant output .
By 2014-08-09 , the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds .
Between the two of those , her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself .
She was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care .
Therefore , she was discharged on 2014-08-09 in good condition .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Metastatic gallbladder cancer .
2. Status post cholecystectomy .
3. Status post transverse colectomy with anastomosis .
4. G tube placement .
5. Feeding jejunostomy .
6. Hypothyroidism .
7. Blood loss requiring transfusion .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms orally once a day .
2. Pantoprazole one tablet once a day .
3. Ambien 10 mg orally before bed .
4. Tylenol # 3 one tablet every four hours as needed for pain .
5. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime .
6. Colace 100 mg twice a day .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Follow-up with the Visiting Nurses Association to arrange assistance with her tube feeding and
her activities of daily living .
The patient is also scheduled for an appointment with Dr. Patterson approximately two weeks after her discharge from the hospital .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder , AF , and h/o CAD a/w hypercarbic respiratory failure .
# Respiratory failure - She was admitted to the CMED CSRU for her repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF .
Pt was diuresed with iv lasix / acetazolamide and given iv morphine / prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried .
However , hypercarbia ( 04-11 metabolic alkalosis ) remained in the 90s .
Pt was mentating okay , having conversations with intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia .
TTE showed preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN .
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS Harold Holcomb to her pulm edema and pulm HTN .
Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin and starting amiodarone .
Family declined valvuloplasty .
For possible COPD , pt was started on steroids and nebs on 08-03 .
Pt is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but needs more O2 when supine .
Pt is a mouth breather and occasionally needs a face mask .
Pt will need I/Os monitored to goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during her CMED stay .
Depending on her I/O , lasix and acetazolamide can be decreased or discontinued .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readdressed .
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes .
Pt was continued on BB , ASA , and nitrates .
# Acid / base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation .
Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today .
Pt failed BIPAP and pCO2 remained in the 90s but maintaining mentation .
# Renal insufficiency - baseline Cr unknown , may have CRI from DM .
Creatinine stayed stable from 1.3-1.5 .
Will need to renally dose all medications .
# A fib - continued BB .
Per cardiology consult recs , discontinued digoxin and started amiodarone .
Due to elevated INR , coumadin was held .
Pt is also paced .
Pt needs to be on amiodarone 400mg BID x 7 days ( loading dose ) and then 400mg daily for maintenance .
# DM - insulin standing + HISS , FS qid
# Depression - continued home regimen
# F/E/N - NPO initially while on BIPAP and now low sodium cardiac diet .
# PPx - supratherpeutic INR
# Access - PIV
# Code - DNR/DNI .
No pressors or central line per HCP .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readressed .

Brief Hospital Course :
This 62 year-old obese male was admitted with cellulitis and presumed bacteremia .
In the John , he was found to be in hypotensive atrial fibrillation .
The patient was admitted to the Medical ICU where his hypotension was managed with IVF hydration and he was maintained on a diltiazam drip for atrial fibrillation .
After his heart rate was controlled , he was transitioned to oral medications and transferred to the medicine service .
1. Cellulitis / Bacteremia
Review of the medical record revealed several previous admissions for cellulitis and bacteremia .
Blood cultures on this admission and were positive for Beta streptococcus Group B .
The patient had previous episodes of the same infection , with lower extremity cellulitis the likely source .
A left lower extremity ultrasound was negative for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient was too large to have a CTA .
He was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn while awaiting culture results .
Once the organism was identified , he was transitioned to a regimen of intravenous penicillin and oral levofloxacin , which had successfully treated the infection during his most recent admission 1 year prior .
He completed 7 days of levofloxacin and had a PICC line placed to facilitate a 2 week course of IV Penicillin .
2. Atrial fibrillation
The patient 's development of atrial fibrillation was believed to be secondary to infection and structural heart disease .
It was initially managed with intravenous diltiazam , and it was later managed with metoprolol and anticoagulation .
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated and elongated left atrium , with a markedly dilated right atrium .
He had occasional episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation that were controlled with responded to IV metoprolol .
However , his rate proved difficult to control despite metoprolol and diltiazam .
The EP service was consulted and recommended transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion .
The TEE was negative for thrombus and the patient was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm with ibutilide .
He was subsequently started on amiodarone and is scheduled to complete a 10 week course .
EKG before discharge showed mild QT prolongation and no effect from amiodarone .
EKG and LFTs should be monitored by his PCP , William given the high dose of amiodarone he will receive .
3. FEN
He was followed by the nutrition team throughout his admission and their recommendations were followed .
He demonstrated several asymptomatic electrolyte deficiecies ; these were likely due to inadequate absorption following his surgery and he responded well to repletion .
Vitamin D and parathyroid tests were pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was discharged to Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield Rehabilitation Hospital in good condition .
He was sent with a King of Hearts monitor and scheduled for follow-up with cardiology and his primary care physician .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , and dilated cardiomyopathy ( with a transthoracic echocardiogram in 2016-01-13 showing an ejection fraction of 40% , posterior and inferior apical akinesis , and large left ventricular thrombus ).
The patient was admitted from 2016-01-21 to 2016-02-03 ; at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
She had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease with normal left main , mid left anterior descending artery 60% , diffuse 90% mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal , serial 70% and 90% left circumflex lesions , and 90% first obtuse marginal , and mid right coronary artery 60% .
During initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the right coronary artery stenosis was found ; for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent .
She was discharged on Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.5 to 3 .
She was then admitted again on 2016-03-30 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft .
At surgery , the descending aorta was noted to be calcified , and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intra-aortic pedunculated lesion .
Given the elevated stroke risk of aortic cross-clamping in the setting of this finding , the plan for a bypass graft was aborted .
The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Physical examination revealed temperature was 99.3 , heart rate was 66 in a normal sinus rhythm , blood pressure was 132/51 , respiratory rate was 22 , and oxygen saturation was 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula .
Swan showed a PA of 29/11 , SVR of 14/9 , cardiac output of 3.86 , cardiac index of 2.14 .
Urine output of 30 cc to 100 cc per hour over the last four hours .
Chest tube showed 30 cc per hour over the last four hours .
In general , the patient was alert and oriented times three .
In no apparent distress and denied pain .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat examination was without bruits .
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm .
Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds .
No audible murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with active bowel sounds .
Extremities were without edema .
Neurologic examination was nonfocal .
Lines included a right antecubital peripheral intravenous .
Chest tube was in place in left internal jugular an pulmonary artery catheter .
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION :
Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 12.7 , hematocrit was 32.4 , platelets were 140 , and mean cell volume was 80 .
Patient was 4.4 , blood urea nitrogen was 14 , creatinine was 0.6 , and glucose was 147 .
INR was 1.2 , partial thromboplastin time was 23.7 , and prothrombin time was 13.4 .
Free calcium was 0.95 on 03-30 .
Phosphate was 3.6 and magnesium was 2.2 .
Arterial blood gas at 3 a.m. demonstrated 7.4/45/125 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit Service for Western Mass .
Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted .
The patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and statin .
Once the patient was titrated off dopamine , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted .
With regard to the left ventricular thrombus , her goal INR remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube
standpoint .
The patient remained comfortable .
By 04-01 , on postoperative day two , the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued .
The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place .
Likewise , on 04-01 , the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty .
Thus , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up .
In addition , the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation .
At this point , it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup .
The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 .
After evaluation and a discussion with Dr. Gunter , it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque , and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted .
At this point , the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for ) was no longer present .
The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 .
By 04-03 , captopril and atenolol were started , and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed .
The patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other symptoms .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Thus , the patient was discharged to home .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP :
The patient was to follow up with her primary care physician ( Dr. Desmet ) , as well as
with Dr. Gunter for an eventual percutaneous coronary intervention , and her surgeon ( Dr. Halcomb ) following her thoracotomy .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease ; 3-vessel disease .
2. Status post aborted coronary artery bypass graft due to mobile aortic atheroma .
3. Diabetes .
4. Hypertension .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :

Date of Birth:   [**2144-3-8**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 40925**] is triplet number two of three
former 1560 gram, 31-1/7 week infant, admitted to the Newborn
Intensive Care Unit for management of prematurity.

antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis
B surface antigen negative, GBS unknown mother. This
pregnancy was achieved by in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization.

She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**]
with a history of vaginal bleeding without any bleeding noted
at the time of admission.  Babies were vertex, vertex and
breech.  Biophysical profile was 8 of 8 for all three infants.
The mother was transferred to the antenatal floor, received
betamethasone and was placed on bed rest.  She developed
cramping and was noted to be 4 centimeters dilated and was
started on magnesium sulfate.  Progressive labor led to a
cesarean section under combined epidural and spinal
anesthesia.  Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of
delivery.

This baby emerged active; received blow-by O2 and was noted
to have some retractions with poor aeration.  She was given
facial C-PAP.  She had Apgars of 8 at one minute and 8 at
five minutes, and was transferred to the Newborn Intensive
Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 97.6 F.,
rectally; heart rate 164; respiratory rate 40s; blood
pressure 48/22 with a mean of 29.  Birth weight 1560 grams,
50th percentile.  Discharge weight 2040, 25th percentile.
Admission head circumference 29.5 centimeters, 50th
percentile; discharge head circumference 31.5, 25th
percentile.  Admission length 42 centimeters, 50th
percentile; discharge length 44 centimeters, greater than
10th percentile.

On physical examination, anterior fontanel soft and flat,
un-dysmorphic, intact palate, normal red reflex o.u.  Fair
aeration, bilateral breath sounds clear.  No murmur, normal
pulses.  Abdomen soft, nontender, three-vessel cord, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Normal female genitalia.  Anterior
displaced anus with short perineum.  Patent anus.  No sacral
dimples; no hip click.  Normal tone for age.

Admission dipstick 33.

REVIEW OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Respiratory:  The infant required intubation and received
two doses of Surfactant; had an initial blood gas of 7.32/44,
quickly weaned and was extubated on day of life one to room air.
She remained in room air with no further respiratory issues.

The baby was loaded with caffeine on day of life one in
preparation for extubation and remained on caffeine until day
of life ten.  She had an occasional episode of apnea and
bradycardia.  At the time of discharge, she has been without any
apnea or bradycardia of prematurity for greater than five days.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The baby initially had two normal saline
boluses for marginally low blood pressure.  She was started
on dopamine with a maximum dose of 6 mgm per kilogram per
hour.  This was discontinued on day of life one.  Since then, she
has been hemodynamically stable with a normal cardiovascular
examination.

3. Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: The baby initially
was n.p.o. with a peripheral intravenous of maintenance
intravenous fluids at 80 cc. per kilogram.  Her initial
dipstick of 31 improved once her peripheral intravenous fluid
was started.  She has had no further issues with
hypoglycemia.  On day of life one she had a PICC line placed
for intravenous fluid.  She was started on parenteral
nutrition.  Enteral feedings were started on day of life two
and advanced without difficulty to full enteral feedings at
150 cc. per kilogram by day of life eight.  Additional
caloric density was added to a total of 26 calories per ounce
of PE with ProMod.

As her weight improved, calories were decreased to 24 kcal/oz.
She is being discharged on Enfamil 24 with iron with supplemental
Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **] at 0.15 cc., p.o. q. day to give 2 mg per kilogram
elemental iron per day.  Her last set of electrolytes and
nutrition labs on [**3-24**], were sodium of 140,
potassium of 5.4, chloride 104, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 21 and
creatinine 0.5.  Alkaline phosphatase 143, albumin 3.9,
calcium 10.3, phosphorus 7.4.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The baby had indirect hyperbilirubinemia
with a peak bilateral on day of life two of 6.9/0.3.  She
responded to phototherapy, which was discontinued on day of
life 6 with a rebound bilirubin of 3.5/0.3.

5.  Hematology:  The baby's admission hematocrit was 48 with
hematocrit on day of life 16 of 37.0 with reticulocyte of
1.1.  The baby did not require any blood products during this
admission.

6.  Infectious Disease:  The baby had an initial sepsis
evaluation with a white count on admission of 8.8, 30 polys,
zero bands, 227 platelets, hematocrit of 44 and 7 nucleated
red blood cells.  She was started on a 48 hour course of
Ampicillin and Gentamicin.  Her clinical condition was
stable.  Blood cultures remained negative so antibiotics were
discontinued at 48 hours.  She has had no further issues with
sepsis.

She has been noted to have some right eye drainage; this has
responded to warm soaks and massage, thought to be a blocked
developing tear duct.

7.  Neurology:  The baby had a head ultrasound on [**3-19**],
which is day of life 11, that showed no evidence of
intraventricular hemorrhage, no periventricular leukomalacia.
The baby's clinical examination is within normal limits.

8.  Sensory:  She has passed her audiology screen.
Ophthalmology examination on [**4-1**], shows mature retina with
plan to follow-up in eight months.

9.  Psycho-Social:  The parents have been visiting; look
forward to transitioning triplet number two [**Known lastname 46**] home, and
baby number one is already home with number three hoping to
be discharged within one week.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with family.

PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Location (un) 38640**],
[**State 350**], telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38641**], fax number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 40927**].

CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Continue Enfamil 24 with iron, ad lib feeding.
2.  Medications:  Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **] 0.15 cc., p.o. day, which equals
2 mg per kilogram per day.
3.  Car Seat Screening passed.
4.  State Newborn Screening Status:  Serial state screens
were sent with the one on [**3-27**], being within normal range.
No concerns.
5.  Immunizations received, none to date.  Plan is to have
all three triplets receive their immunizations after
discharge as number three is not big enough to receive hers
at this time.
6.  Immunizations recommended:
Synargis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**]
through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three
criteria:  1) Born at less than 32 weeks; 2) born between 32
and 35 weeks with plans for day care during RSV season, with

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 44 year-old male with h/o metastatic renal cell
carcinoma s/p nephrectomy and renal insuficiency who is admitted
for BP control and concern about cognitive function.
.
He presented this morning to outpatient oncology clinic to get a
CT torso follow up CT scan. He has been on Sutent therapy since
[**Month (only) 404**].
He was admitted early for pre-hydration due his poor renal
function. He received mucomist, d51/2 normal and d5/Bicarb, He
also discontinued his lisinopril per renal recomendations and
his metoprolol was increased to control his BP. BP elevation is
common in the setting of sutent therapy. At home, his BP has
been ranging 140s-170s/ 80s-90s. While in the treatment area, he
reported a frontal headache with elevated BP 186/104. He was
given tylenol for headache, and IV BP meds including hydralazine
and lasix. Upon evaluation, he also had difficulties performing
""serial 7's"" which was a significant change from his baseline.
.
Of note, in [**7-10**]/[**2187**], he developed posterior
leukoencephalopathy in the setting of gemcitabine and Sutent
chemotherapy. He did required ICU care to control his BP with
esmolol and NTG. Per oncology fellow report, the first sign of
his rapid deterioration was inability to perform serial 7. He
later on deteriorated until he was unable to recognize his wife
or remember his [**Hospital1 **] names.
.
Given this prior episode, there was a concern for rapid
deterioriation and being unable to control his BP properly.
.
He received a total of Hydralaxine 30 mg, lisinopril 40 po and
lasix 10 mg Iv with still Bp in the 170's. Of note, he also has
been gaining weight over the last 3 weeks ~ 30 pounds. with
worsenign abdominal distension and lower extremity edema.

Continued followup recommended. No evidence of an acute infarct.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2189-2-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression of disease as demonstrated by the
development of innumerable new pulmonary nodules in comparison
to the torso CT of [**2188-12-1**]. New and enlarging hepatic
metastases as well as interval increase in size of nephrectomy
bed and retroperitoneal lesions as compared to [**2189-1-21**].
2. Increasing bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Ground-glass nodular opacities at the lung bases, which could
reflect atelectasis and underlying nodules, although
lymphangiectatic tumor spread is not entirely excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 44 year-old male with h/o metastatic renal
cancer s/p nephrectomy currently on sutent therapy who admitted
with elevated BP and change in cognitive function. The patient
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**Date range (1) 10649**] for further control of
BP. Hospital course is as follows by problem:

# Hypertension: The patient had prior episode of posterior
leukoencephalopathy in the setting of hyptertensive urgency
requiring strict BP control. He is on Lisinopril and a BB at
home, with etiology of hypertension believed to be [**1-3**] to
sutent. The patient's ACEI was held given planned contrast study
and in this setting had elevated SBP up to 186 w/ question of
mental status changes.  Given concern for possible reoccurance
of prior leukoencephalopathy, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for tight BP control.  At time of admission, patient c/o only
mild headache and denied chest pain, SOB, palpitations. EKG was
unremarkable. He was initially on IV medications, including
esmolol and hydralazine prn. He was transitioned to oral
medications which was uptitrated as necessary to Metoprolol 50mg
TID and Hydralazine 75 mg TID. Lisnopril was not restarted given
hyperkalemia (see below).
.
# Decrease in cognitive function: Upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the
patient was alert and oriented x3 with normal neurological exam.
No deficits were noted on mini-mental. Strict BP control was
attempted as above. Neurological exam remained stable throughout
admission. MRI [**2-18**] showed possible resolving posterior
reversible leukoencephalopathy with no acute infarct seen on
imaging.
.
# Onc/ renal cell carcinoma: The patient is currently on sutent
therpay, as above. CT Torso [**2-18**] shows interval progression of
disease. He will f/u in onc clinic on [**2-23**] for further
discussion of management.
.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia and
nephritic range proteinuria with baseline K+ between [**4-7**]. On
admission he had a K of 7, which trended down to 5.3 with lasix,
kayexalate, and sodium bicarbonate. EKG was unremarkable, as
above. Etiology was felt to possibly be secondary to RTA &
non-complaince with home regimen of kayexalate & sodium bicarb.
.
# CKD: The patient has chronic disease with baseline creatinine
1.7 and known nephrotic range proteinuria thought to be
secondary to Torisel. The patient had a urine Anion Gap +18
consistent with RTA, but urinary ph 5.5. He is followed by the
renal service as outpatient. Creatinine remained stable
throughout admission with no acute issues. He will f/u in
nephrology clinic for further management.
.
# Diffuse edema: The patient had diffuse edema likely secondary
to nephrotic range proteinuria. There were no signs of pulmonary
edema. Per his report, gaining weight over last 3 weeks. This
improved throughout admission with lasix.
 .
# Anemia: The patient has a history of normocytic, normochronic
anemia with BL HCT in mid-20s. He was transfused 1u PRBC on [**2-20**]
for HCT 23 and was given IV lasix before and after transfusion
to prevent fluid overload. He tolerated this well with
appropriate increase in hct.
.
# The patient was discharged home on [**2-21**] in good condition,
afebrile, VSS, with mental status at baseline and improved BP
control. He will f/u in onc clinic on [**2-23**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1) UPPER GI BLEED:
EGD and initial care in ICU as described in HPI.  After arriving
on floor, pt's Hct remained at around 31, stable.  He had no
further clinical evidence of bleeding.  He continued on a PPI.
HE will f/u with GI for a repeat EGD in [**6-14**] weeks to determine
source of bleed, possible biopsy of lesions seen.
.
2) EtOH:
PT did not feel he had a problem with etoh.  He was told to
refrain from alcohol use.
.
3) Thrombocytopenia:
Plt 95 from 147 on admission. Likely secondary to consumption in
setting of massive GI bleed vs EtOH use.  Fibrinogen normal.
Plt rebounde to 112 on discharge.
.
4) Transaminitis/LFT abnormalities:
Trending down. RUQ U/S with fatty liver. HBV panel c/w prior
immunization; HCV Ab negative. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to EtOH use,
although pt denies heavy use.  Should have outpt monitoring,
potential referral to hepatology for biopsy.
.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a Vietnamese-speaking 58 y.o. man with a PMH of a
positive PPD, depression, PTSD, POW during [**Country 3992**] war, hernia
with repair, and chronic back pain. He was admitted to the ICU
[**2157-7-9**] with complaints of dizziness, HA, fatigue, dyspnea, and
a 13 lb wt loss over the last one month. Pt also c/o spitting up
BRB since one day prior to admission with reports of 400cc
hemoptysis in the ED. He also c/o nausea and vomiting.  He
denies CP/Palpitations/fevers chills/sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has a
history of a positive PPD with 6 months INH treatment. He
endores abdominal pain which he has had since his bilateral
hernia repairs. He also endorses urinary hesitancy but denies
dysuria. Recent colonoscopy showed adenoma, no bleeding.

While in the ICU there were no witnessed episodes of hemoptysis
or bloody emesis.  The patient's Hct continued to fluctuate,
dropping from 39 to 27 and then returning to 33.  Bronchoscopy
did not show any evidence of acute bleed, and showed normal lung
findings.  The patient was guiac negative, and studies for
hemolysis were also negative.  CXR and CT were negative for
pathology.  NG lavage was negative.

On the day of transfer, the patient reported he was still
spitting up blood.  Given his previous psych history of
depression, PTSD, and possible psychosis, he was transferred to
the floor for further psychiatric evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 y.o. Vietmanese man with h/o +PPD, with 2-3 wks increasing
fatigue, wt loss, and spitting up blood x 1 day. The patient
presented to the ED hemodynamically stable. In ED, coughed up
400 cc of BRB. CXR clear, NG lavage neg. SBP decreased into the
80's (baseline 100-110), HR up to 70's (baseline 40-50's). HCT
decreased from 39 to 35.8, then to 36.9 after 8 L NS. Torso CT
neg. SBP further dropped into the 70's after IVF, but patient
was mentating well, with good urine output. RIJ central line
placed. Rec'd 4 mg IV dex given hypotension and 7.6% eos on
peripheral smear. No blood products rec'din ED. CT, CXR
negative.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the ICU in a negative pressure room,
given his h/o +PPD and new hemoptysis with constitutional
findings, to r/o TB (although neg CXR/CT, afebrile). Other
possible etiologies included upper GI bleed (although NG lavage
neg, Guaiac neg) or nasopharyngeal dx (no h/o trauma, no active
nasal or OP bleeding). Other respiratory etiologies were also
considered including resp AVM or resp-renal d/o (nml cr).

IV Fluids with NS were continued and the patient maintained good
BP's, without the need for pressor support. HCT decreased from
30.3-->28.9-->27.7. No active bleeding per mouth or nose
appreciated. No hemoptysis or hematemesis. He was transfused
with 1U PRBC's and HCT increased to 30. It remained stable at 30
overnight. Bronchoscopy was performed in the ICU, and
demonstrated normal airways with no bleeding. AFB per BAL was
negative, and sputum AFB also negative.

The patient was discussed with both GI and [**Known lastname **], who felt given
his clinical stability and stable HCT, endoscopy/fiberoptic
scope were not indicated at this time. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was set for
discharge home from the ICU given his improvement over the last
two days, however on [**7-13**] he again complained of spitting up BRB
overnight. However, no bleeding was seen overnight either by the
nursing staff or by the housestaff. There was no blood seen per
mouth/nose or blood on the pillows/sheets. In addition, the
patient reported spitting up over a liter of blood, which would
not have gone un-noticed with continual care in the ICU setting.
Therefore, we did not feel comfortable sending him home with the
thought that he might be confused or delusional. He does have a
psych history w/ PTSD for which he recieves medications. In
addition he appeared to have a flat affect and per his family
seemed anxious/depressed about his current situation. Psychiatry
evaluated the patient and found him stable for discharge. He was
also encouraged to follow-up with his home PCP and Psychiatrist.
 Physical therapy also evaluated the patient and recommend
continued PT care. Hct remained stable 33-34 while on the floor,
and he was discharge to home

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old male with a history of gastric ulcers,
HTN, HLD old CVA without deficits who had bloody emesis on
morning of admit.

Hematemesis: On admission, 2 large bore PIVs were placed and PPI
drip was initiated. NGT tube was placed and revealed about 200cc
of coffee ground emesis with some bright red blood.  The BRB
cleared after 200cc NS was flushed. The patient's Hct fell from
a baseline of 41 to a nadir of 29. He was transfused a total of
3 units pRBCs. He underwent EGD which showed gastritis and a
non-bleeding ulcer in the duodenal apex which was injected with
epinephrine.  The patient's antihypertensive medications were
held and he briefly needed NTG gtt for hypertension after volume
repletion. The patient had a single episode of temperatures to
101 during the time of transfusion. Blood culutres yielded no
growth prior to discharge.  Following EGD, general surgery was
consulted who felt no surgical intervention was necessary.
Hematocrit stabilized and the patient required no further
transfusions.  The patient'as diet was advanced and he tolerated
PO intake.  He was switched to PO PPI [**Hospital1 **].   After positive H.
polyri antibody test, treatment for H. pylori was initiated with
Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin and PPI x 10 days. He will follow up
in [**Hospital **] clinic after discharge.

ECG changes: On the day of arrival, the patient had mild ST
depressions inferior/laterally which resolved with pRBC
transfusion and were not assoicated with CE leak. They were
likely related to demand in setting of bleed. Miocardial
infarction was ruled out by negative cardiac biomarkers.

HTN: Antihypertensives were transiently held in the setting of
GI bleed and re-started prior to discharge.

Hyperlipedemia: Atorvastatin was held in acute setting and
re-started after EGD.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you developed
lightheadedness, dizziness, vomited blood and had bleeding from
below. Tests performed at the hospital showed that you had a
bleed from your stomach or small intestine.  An endoscopy was
performed to look for the source or bleeding and located an
ulcer, which was injected with epinephrine to help stop bleed.
After the procedure, you were observed closely to make sure you
did not have a repeat bleed.  However, your red blood cells
remained stable and there was no evidence of further bleeding.
You tested positive for bacteria known as H. pylori, which
causes ulcers in the small intestine.  We prescribed you
medicine to eracidate this bacterium.  You are now ready to be
discharged home.

We made the following changes to your medicaitons:

1. We prescribed you Pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **].  Please make sure to
take this medicine as directed to prevent repeat bleeds.  Do not
stop it unless told specifically to do so by your doctor.

2. We started you on Amoxicillin 1 gram twice a day. Please take
it for 8 more days, for a total of 10 days of antibiotics.

3. We started you on Clarithromycin 500mg twice a day.  Please
take it for 8 more days, for a total of 10 days.

4. We stopped your Aspirin.  Please do not take that medicine
until told otherwise by your doctor.

Please continue to take all your other medications as
prescribed.

You have follow-up appointments with your GI doctor and in
[**Hospital 1944**] clinic (see below).

future treatment plans. Patient admitted to Neuro ICU given the
mass effect and possible quick detoriation. His Ct of head most
likly consistent with high grade glioma which is confirmed with
biopsy. Patient loaded with dilantin ,started on mannitol with
hold parameters. MRI of the brain is significant for large
peripherally enhancing heterogeneous lesion in the left
occipital, temporal, and parietal regions with extension into
the left lateral ventricle with either cyst formation or central
necrosis.

Chest abdominal and pelvic CT did not show primary malignant
diasease. Neuro-oncology consulted and followed along during
this hospitalization. Patient talen to OR on [**2199-7-4**] for
Left-sided parietal craniotomy for resection and biopsy under
general anestheasia without intraoperative complications.
estimated blood loss during the case is 200cc. Preliminary
pathology consistent with glioblastoma. Postoperatively he was
transferred to the PACU where he remained overnight for close
neurologic monitoring.  He had post op head CT which showed good

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated

History of Present Illness:
21 year old Male h/o EtOH and marijuana abuse, EtOH
pancreatitis, and multiple sports-related concussions who
presents with syncope and mental status change. He had a head
injury 2 days prior to admission at work after hitting his head
on a refrigerator door. He experienced confusion and amnesia but
did not have loss of consciousness. The patient then suffered a
MVC one day prior to admission, car vs pole, and it was unclear
if he had head trauma or LOC. He was evaluated at [**Hospital 13056**]
Hospital, where he had a negative head CT per report. On the day
of admission he experienced headache, confusion, and an episode
of syncope while hyperventilating, and was caught by his mother
prior to hitting the floor. He was unconscious and unresponsive
to painful stimuli for 5 mins, however did not have convulsions.
When he awoke, he was even more confused and unable to respond
to questions. He did not complain of neck pain chest pain or
abdominal pain or other extremity pain. Per his family, today
was supposed to be a reunion, but may have proven to be more
stressful for him than anticipated. His father found a bottle of
gin in his backpack.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: HR 72, BP 110/65, RR 18, T 97.8. He
was initially only oriented to self, and intermittently became
combative. After sedation with Versed, he was calm, able to
answer questions, and was AO x3. Labs were notable for AST 63,
lactate 2.5, Blood Alcohol was 305. He was placed in a c-collar
and then intubated for altered mental status. ABG after
intubation 7.38/46/425/28 on CMV 510/100/14/5. FAST exam
negative, he had a laceration on posterior shoulder which his
mother attributes to a cut while shaving. CT torso showed no
acute injuries to the chest, abdomen or pelvis. NCHCT showed no
acute intracranial process. CT C-spine showed no acute fracture
or malalignment. Neurosurgery was consulted but felt there was
no need for intervention, atributing his delerium to
intoxication and concussion, and did not recommend Dilantin.
Surgery was consulted and saw no injuries on exam, will follow.
He was given fentanyl, midazolam, propofol. He was admitted to
the MICU for extubation and frequent neuro checks.

Ultimately he was extubated and transferred to the floor, where
he continued in alcohol withdrawal.

increased dosing of valium to keep his CIWA < 10.
- He recieved Thiamine, Folate and a MVI
- He was seen by social work and plans were made for him to
transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] directly to an inpatient alcohol treatment
center.
- Patient was medically stable for transfer at time of discharge

2. Post-Concussive Sydrome
- Headache treated with tylenol
- By report the patient has had multiple concussions, and may
benefit from a neurologic evaluation as an outpatient, but this
is a chronic issue to best be addressed by his PCP

3. Anxiety
- Patient treated with ativan 1mg Q8H

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   His physical examination shows his
heart rate to be 58 and in sinus rhythm; blood pressure
154/77; respiratory rate is 14 with an O2 saturation of 99%
on three liters of nasal cannula.  He is in general a
pleasant male who is awake and alert and lying on the

Show bilateral lower extremity edema with stasis changes,
left anterior shin dark.  He has no edema and no evidence of
varicosities.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis.  The skin
examination shows multiple well healed surgical scars.  His
neurological examination shows strength to be equal on
bilateral upper and lower extremities.  His pulse examination

popliteal pulses are one plus bilaterally and dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis are two plus bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 8.4, hematocrit of
36.6, platelet count 228,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.8,
chloride 104, carbon dioxide 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8 and a
blood glucose of 113.   His liver enzymes were all within
normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2156-9-16**], the patient underwent
a cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction
of 60%; no mitral regurgitation.  His left main coronary
artery was short with moderate calcifications; left anterior
descending artery has proximal moderate calcifications with a
70% tubular lesion at the ostium.  The first diagonal has a
90% lesion at the origin; left circumflex has a 70% lesion at
the origin and 90% lesion at the bifurcation of the obtuse
marginal 1.  The distal left patent ductus arteriosus with
competitive flow.  His right coronary artery is co-dominant
with an 80% lesion at the origin.

A consultation was then put in to Cardiac Surgery for a
possible coronary artery bypass graft and a question of an
aortic valve replacement.

On [**2156-9-17**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass graft times four with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery; saphenous vein graft to left
patent ductus arteriosus; saphenous vein graft to the right
patent ductus arteriosus and a saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal.  He also had an aortic valve replacement
with a #23 millimeter pericardial DE valve.

This surgery was performed under general endotracheal
anesthesia with cardiopulmonary bypass time of 174 minutes
and a cross clamp time of 140 minutes.  The surgery was
performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 54443**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], PA-C and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], N.P. as assistants.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Surgical Cardiac Recovery Unit with atrial pacing
wires, two ventricular pacing wires, two mediastinal and one
left pleural chest tube.  He was on a Neo-Synephrine drip and
a Propofol drip and paced at 74 beats per minute.

Intraoperatively, the patient had been coagulopathic and had
received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of
fresh frozen plasma, two units of platelets and protamine.
When he arrived in the Intensive Care Unit, he did receive
more fresh frozen plasma to help control bleeding.

By the morning of postoperative day number one, he was awake,
but agitated.  His ventilator was weaned to extubate.  He was
extubated on postoperative day number one, but throughout the
day continued to have increasing secretions and was
re-intubated.  He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy at the
bedside on postoperative day number two, where it was noted
that he had thick secretions in both the right and left main
stem bronchi.  He was then kept intubated for the following
couple of days, again bronched for copious secretions.

On postoperative day number four, he was extubated without
incident.  During this time that he was intubated, his chest
tubes were discontinued without incident.  On postoperative
day number five, he remained in the unit and had intermittent
periods of confusion and delirium.  He did remain this way
until the following day, but he was thought to be ready for
discharge to the floor.

He was transferred to the Surgical Floor on postoperative day
number six, and continued to be pleasantly confused.  He did
have a Code Purple called on postoperative day number six in
the evening as the patient attempted to leave the floor.  He
was then started on Haldol and was more cooperative by the
morning. Throughout this time, he continued to work with
Physical Therapy and by postoperative day number seven, they
felt that he could be cleared for discharge to home.

By postoperative day number seven, his confusion was present
at times and he still does have hallucinations but he has
been stable and it is felt that he will be ready to be
discharged to home on postoperative day number eight.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   His discharge examination shows his
vital signs to be stable with a heart rate of 71, blood
pressure of 138/71; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation of 99%
on room air.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm.  He has
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  His
extremities show one plus pitting edema bilaterally.  His
incision was clean, dry and intact; sternum is stable.

LABORATORY:  On discharge is white blood cell count of 7.3,
hematocrit of 26.7, platelet count of 346,000.  Sodium of
139, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 29,
creatinine 1.1 and blood glucose of 81.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-27**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 3. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. An
ascending aortic graft is noted consistent with previous
replacement surgery. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate(2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: For the
post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including epinephrine and phenylephrine. 1. A
well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral position
with normal leaflet motion and gradients. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. 2. An ascending aortic and arch graft is
also seen. 3. Biventricular function is unchanged, AI is
unchanged. 4. Other findings are unchanged
[**10-29**] Head CT: There is diffuse cerebral edema identified with
compression of the ventricles. There is obliteration of the
basal cisterns identified with deformity of the brain stem
indicating central herniation. At the foramen magnum, downward
displacement of the cerebellar tonsils indicates tonsillar
herniation. There are multiple infarcts identified bilaterally
involving the posterior cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries
as well as the right superior cerebellar artery as well as the

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 5719**] was admitted and taken directly to the operating
room with plans for a redo-sternotomy, along with aortic and
mitral valve replacements. Unfortunately due to a very fragile
and heavily calcified aorta along with adherent scar tissue,
aortic valve replacement could not be performed. Mitral valve
replacement was performed along with an unplanned replacement of
her ascending aorta and total arch with reimplantation of the
head vessels which required circulatory arrest for 24 minutes.
For additional surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, she was brought to the
CVICU in critical condition. Due to the heavily calcified aorta
and unplanned circulatory arrest, there was much concern for
neurologic injury. Over 48 hours, she remained unreponsive. A
head CT scan on postoperative day two showed diffuse cerebral
edema with deformity of the brain stem indicating central
herniation. There was also downward displacement of the
cerebellar tonsils indicating tonsillar herniation. The CT scan
also showed multiple infarcts involving the posterior cerebral
and anterior cerebral arteries as well as the right superior
cerebellar artery as well as the watershed distribution. No
hemorrhage was identified. The neurology service was consulted
and brain death examination was performed on [**10-30**].  After
declaration of brain death, a family meeting was held, and the
patient was withdrawn from ventilatory support.  She expired
soon after.  The medical examiner was notified, and post mortem
was refused.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female
with an extensive past medical history including atrial
fibrillation, coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, and
came to the hospital on [**2134-9-1**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   At that time she was admitted for an
elective procedure for lumbar decompression. The patient had been
confined to a wheelchair, and therefore, it was felt that despite
her advanced age she was an acceptable surgical risk for surgery
to correct the spinal stenosis.
Following surgery, she was in severe pain treated with very high
doses of morphine and was noted to be very lethargic with a
decreased right arm and incoherent speech.  CT of the brain was
done on [**9-2**] that was normal, but she continued to not be
able to arouse. MRI was done on [**9-3**] which showed a left
occipital 1 X 1 hemorrhage on susceptibility weighted imaging
with blood layering out posteriorly in both lateral ventricles.
There were no areas of restricted diffusion, no mass affect
or shift was noted.
The patient was then evaluated by Neurology, that noted the
patient to be quite lethargic, but able to open her eyes and
answer questions. She did indeed appear to be weaker on the right
and very weak in both legs bilaterally. A test dose of Narcan
managed to improved her symptoms suggesting that most of her
symptoms were due to the high dose of morphine that she received
post-op.
During the next few days she did improve  especially in her
mental status and strenght in her upper extremities.
On [**9-4**], due to the decreased mental status a repeat head
CT was obtained which now showed the blood seen in the
ventricles and in the left occipital lobe, but no other acute
changes. Becaouse of concern that she may not be able to protect
her airways due to sedation, the patient was kept in the
Intensive Care Unit during this entire time. During her ICU stay
as she was noted to develop decreasing strength in her legs
bilaterally both proximally and distally, and it was noted that
her reflexes which had previously been intact  were now
decreased. It was therefore decided to emergently obtain a MRI of
the lumbar spine which demonstrated an L3-L4 and L4-L5 epidural
hematoma. She was taken back to the operating room on [**9-7**],
where the epidural hematoma was evacuated and a drain was left in
place.
Following the surgery she did much better.  Her strength
began to return to her legs, and her reflexes were also noted
to be better.
Postoperatively, the question was whether or not to restart
her on her anticoagulation because of her atrial fibrillation
which had been held due to her recent surgery and also to the
fact that she had a hemorrhage in the surgical site.  Cardiology
was consulted, and they felt that anticoagulation she should be
restarted on Coumadin. She was started on Occupational Therapy
and Physical Therapy, who worked initially with her with passive
range of motion but later in the course was able to sit up in a
chair, able to stand for brief period; although, she was not yet
able to walk.
From a mental status point of view, she did better upon
transfer out of the unit and appeared to be doing well.
However, a few days later she was noted again to have a
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course.  Further investigation revealed
that she was sleeping poorly at night and more during the
day, and it was felt that this may have represented a
derangement of her sleep/awake cycle, and she was placed on
trazodone for sleep prophylaxis.  It was noted that certain
times during the day she was very alert and seemed to be
doing very well, so further imaging was held off on.  She
continued to have difficulties with poor swallowing, and it
was felt that no neurological abnormality could be found for
this.  She had a number of video swallow studies which all
demonstrated a weak swallow mechanism.  She was fed via
nasogastric tube during this time.  An ENT consultation was
obtained which is still pending at this time, but the
suspicion was that this may be due to vocal cord injury
secondary to intubation during the surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Prior to discharge, the
patient was alert and oriented.  Her physical examination was
significant for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Heart
otherwise had a regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen was benign.  Her back examination
revealed a healing surgical site; although, there was some
wound breakdown along the edge of the site felt by Surgery to
be due to incomplete nutritional status.  On neurologic
examination she alert and oriented.  Her motor testing was as
follows on the left:  Deltoids were [**6-5**], biceps [**6-5**], triceps
4+/5, wrist extensors [**6-5**], finger extensors [**6-5**], hip flexor
was 4-/5, knee flexor 4+/5, knee extensor 4+/5, plantar
extension was 4-/5, plantar flexion was 3+/5.  On the right:
Deltoids were 4+/5, biceps [**6-5**], triceps 4+/5, wrist extensors
[**6-5**], finger extensors [**6-5**], hip flexor was [**5-6**], knee flexor
4-/5, knee extensor [**5-6**], plantar extension was 3+/5, plantar
flexion was [**4-5**].  Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric
in the upper extremities and at the knees.  They were absent
at the ankles, and the toes were mute bilaterally.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was afebrile.  She was
hemodynamically stable.  She was not able to ambulate
independently.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was to be discharged to
rehabilitation facility for acute postoperative
rehabilitation.  The final decision as to which institution
will be decided by the patient and her family and appended to
this report.

FINDINGS: Comparison with [**2156-5-29**]. No hydrocephalus, shift
of normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarct is
identified. There is prominence of the sulci and ventricles;
however, this is not significantly changed since the last

Brief Hospital Course:
A/p: [**Age over 90 **] yo M

1. GI Bleed: patient with mult episodes of BRBPR.  Likely from
lower source given that Hct slowly going down.  Has remained
hemodynamically stable in ED.   No reoccurrence of GI bleed in
past 3 days. Location of bleed is yet to be determined. Bleeding
test was negative.  Continue to monitor for any changes.
Colonoscopy is necessary to determine location, as per GI. HCT
has been running in 27-29 for the past  days. It has been stable
but it low. Lab results today show that crit has decreased to
27.6. A unit of blood is necessary as the crit has dropped.
Discussed patient with GI. GI is following patient. Feel that he
is stable at the moment. [**Name2 (NI) **] plan from them. ON [**8-9**], crit had
increased to over 30. Still awaiting decision if f/u colonoscopy
is warranted given pt HX with the prep. Pt was given senna and
had 200 cc melena over night on [**8-12**]. Pt had not had bowel
movement since GI prep; this could just be residual blood from
initial GIB/. Repeat colonoscopy was decided against due to pts
present state

.
2. Delirium: Pt has remained in a confused state  for the past 4
days. He has been placed in restraints due to threatening
behavior and trying to pull at tubes. MS change has been
improving. He remains confused. He is responsive to voice and
tactile stimulation. Pt is mumbling but beginning to make more
sense. Concern remains what MS change is due to. Infectious work
up is in process. Began pt on olanzapine as per geriatric
consult. Pt had a run of SVT over the night on [**8-7**] but was
easily arousable. NO concern felt. ON [**8-8**], pt was conversing.
He appeared to be returning to his original state. Foley was d/c
and ucx and BCX taken. ucx was negative. UA obtained showed some
bacteria and WBC. That evening, Foley replaced due to lack of
output. Pt became combative and was given olanzapine. On rounds
on [**8-9**], pt unarousable. Tried to arouse him with multiple
stimuli with little response.  Suction was used to remove sputum
and fluid accumulating in his throat and mouth. Pt was
responsive to this measure. His eyes would bunch up and he tried
to block the suction.   His blood pressure decreased to 90/60.
But then returned between 118-120 and then increased to 130/85.
CXR showed Left retrocardiac opacity. Pt afternoon, pt
responsive and more alert. D/c haldol and olanzapine. If
combative, pt will be placed in restraints. Trying to have
patient come off the past medications. On [**8-9**], began Levaquin
due to CXR showing possible aspiration pneumonia and a possible
UTI as shown by UA. These are both possible causes for patients
current state. Marked improvement noted on [**8-10**]. Pt became more
responsive and was able to tell the story of how he ended up in
the hospital. SPS consulted again for evaluation. Vanco was d/c
as blood CX on [**8-3**] showed that bacteria was susceptible to
oxacillin.
-Bacteremia seems to be the cause of the delirium

Pt given trazodone and lodaxaprine on the night of [**8-10**]. The
following morning, pt arousable but became agitated. Mitt
restraints initiated to stop patient from pulling foley. Pt
continues to wax and wane in his knowledge of place and time.
The AM of [**8-12**], pt was conversive and alert to his location. He
then proceeded to begin pulling on his IV and trying to removed
bandages. Pt continues to have bouts of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. He
alert to people but confused over who people are and various
events that are occurring.
.
3. HTN: Hydralazine
- if pt becomes re-oriented, possibly return to Univasc 15mg PO
daily. On [**8-13**],  began Univasc as replacement for hydralazine.

4.PPX: pneumonic boots have been placed on patient since initial
changes. Request for patient to be repositioned q2h to avoid
pressure ulcers.

5. FEN: Pt begun on D5W upon admission. When MS change,
continued on D5W. On [**8-9**], begun on D5 [**12-28**] N. SPS consulted and
found pt should remain NPO. Decision made to check the next day
for alertness. If pt remains alert and partially oriented, SPS
will be re consulted. if not, NG tube and nutrition consult will
be obtained. SPS reevaluated patient on [**8-11**] and determined that
soft foods are acceptable. Recommended a video swallow which
showed that ground food was acceptable. Switched all meds to PO
form to see how patient fairs.

"Admission Date: [**2145-9-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2145-11-4**]

Date of Birth:  [**2145-9-17**]        Sex:  M

Service:  Neonatology


HISTORY:  The patient is 30 and [**1-26**]-week twin delivered
preterm due to concerns for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing
in the setting of twin-twin transfusion syndrome with growth
discrepancy. The patient was born to a 33-year-old G4/P3 (to
5) mother with prenatal laboratories; blood type O+, antibody
negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, GBS unknown.

[**Hospital **] MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for type 2 diabetes,
managed with insulin. Was a spontaneous mono-di twin
gestation, otherwise unremarkable until routine ultrasound
showed discrepancy of growth as well as oligohydramnios of
twin #2.

DELIVERY COURSE:  Mother was given betamethasone and
delivered afterwards. Twin #2 with Apgar's of 4 and 7,
requiring initial positive pressure ventilation during
resuscitation due to poor color and tone as well as a heart
rate of 80. Upon admission, the patient had a weight of 1280
grams (35th percentile), length of 40 cm (which is 50th
percentile), head circumference of 28.5 cm (which is 50th
percentile).

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  RESPIRATORY: The patient was intubated and received
    surfactant, transitioned to CPAP on day of life #3, and
    has been in room air since [**2145-10-25**]. Infant was
    started on caffeine for apnea of prematurity.  Caffeine
    was discontinued on [**2145-10-20**].  Last bradycardia was noted
    on [**10-29**] which was associated with a feeding.  The infant
    has been without any cardiorespiratory events since that
    time.
2.  CARDIOVASCULAR: No significant hypo or hypertension. The
    patient has a [**1-25**] to 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard
    over precordium and radiating strongly to both axillae,
    consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis. The patient
    has not had signs of a patent ductus arteriosus such as
    hypotension, feeding intolerance, or respiratory distress
    out of proportion to degree of prematurity. Therefore,
    this murmur is thought to be PPS by clinical criteria.
3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, NUTRITION: The patient had full
    volume feeds by day of life #10 and feedings were
    supplemented to 30 kilocalories/ounce for weight gain
    until [**2145-10-14**].  Calories were then weaned to the
    current regimen of Breastmilk 24 kilocalories per ounce
    (supplemented with similac powder). The infant has been
    taking all po feedings since [**2145-10-27**].
4.  GI: The patient had a maximum bilirubin level of 7.1 on
    [**2145-9-24**]. Status post phototherapy, rebound was
    3.1 on [**2145-9-27**].
5.  HEMATOLOGY: Last hematocrit on [**2145-9-18**] was 43.
    No history of abnormal white blood cell or platelet
    values.
6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient is status post rule out
    sepsis with 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin at
    onset of life until cultures were returned as negative.
7.  NEUROLOGY: A head ultrasound on [**2145-9-29**] was
    normal.
8.  AUDIOLOGY: A hearing screen was performed with automated
    auditory brain stem responses. The baby passed on
    [**2145-11-3**].
9.  OPHTHALMOLOGY: Eyes examined on [**2145-10-18**] and were
    found to be immature zone 3 with followup recommended for
    3 weeks; appointment is scheduled for [**2145-11-9**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home.

[**2130-6-10**] CT Scan:
CTA CHEST: There is a focal intramural hematoma with associated
large penetrating ulcer within the aortic arch approximately 1.2
cm distal to the left subclavian origin. There is no free
extravasation of contrast. The ascending and descending aorta
are of normal caliber measuring 3.3 x 3.3 cm and 2.8 x 2.4 cm
respectively at the level of the main pulmonary artery. The main
pulmonary artery is normal without filling defects. Scattered
mediastinal lymph nodes including a 7-mm precarinal node are not
enlarged. A 6-mm spiculated ground glass nodule in the right
upper lobe (3:30) is slightly more conspicuous. A 2- mm
subpleural nodule (3:40) and 3- mm right lower lobe nodule are
unchanged. There are dependant atelectatic changes at the lung
bases. There is a small hiatal hernia and no pleural effusions.
CTA ABDOMEN: There is a 14-mm cyst within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the
liver. A smaller hypodensity within the inferior right hepatic
lobe likely represents a cyst as well. The spleen,pancreas,
adrenal glands and right kidney are unremarkable. A tiny
hypodensity in the lower pole of the left kidney likely
represents a cyst, but is not fully characterized. There are no
enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes. There are
mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta,
which is of normal caliber.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 75890**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical ICU for strict
blood pressure control. Chest CTA confirmed findings of focal
intramural hematoma with large penetrating ulcer within the
aortic arch. CTA was also notable for subtle spiculated ground
glass opacity in the right upper lobe. She remained pain free
and slowly weaned from Nipride infusion. She transitioned to PO
Metoprolol and Amlodipine. Given radiographic findings, surgical
intervention was not indicated at this time. Over several days,
her antihypertensive regimen was titrated for goal systolic
blood pressure less than 120-130mmHg. She remained pain free and
was medically cleared for discharge on [**6-13**]. In regards to
her aortic ulcer, she will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in
3 months time with CTA of her torso. Given findings of
ground-glass opacity, a dedicated followup chest CT in six
months is recommended for further evaluation.

Date of Birth:  [**2192-1-1**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] is the 30-3/7 week gestation baby boy
[**Name2 (NI) **] to a 24-year-old Gravida 1, para 0, now 1 mother with
[**Name2 (NI) **] type A+, antibody screen negative, hepatitis B surface
antigen negative. Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive. GBS status
unknown secondary to preterm labor and prolonged preterm
rupture of membranes. Mom had been on Ampicillin and
Erythromycin. She received betamethasone. The infant was
delivered by vaginal delivery. He emerged vigorous with good
cry. Nuchal cord x1. Apgars were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5
minutes. He was admitted to the NICU for further evaluation.

Admission weight 1470  grams, head circumference 26 cm,
length 40.5 cm. Anterior fontanel was open and flat. There
was a caput present. His clavicles were intact. His palate
was intact. He had clear breath sounds with fair aeration.
Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur, good femoral pulses. His
abdomen was soft, nondistended with no masses. He was pink
and well perfused with a patent anus. He had normal external
male genitalia and he moved all extremities equally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the NICU is as follows.

Respiratory: He remained on room air after birth and was
started on Caffeine. He was in need of nasal cannula oxygen
around one month of life secondary to chronic lung
disease. He began chlorothiazide on day of life 43.
This was discontinued after 2 weeks with no
significant improvement in his respiratory status. He was
weaned to room air by day of life 48 and has been on room air
ever since. He had mild apnea of prematurity but his caffeine was
discontinued on day of life 23. He had desaturationss and
bradycardia's with feedings but has been without significant
bradycardia for greater than 5 days prior to his discharge.

Cardiovascular: He was stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint throughout his stay with normal [**Name2 (NI) **] pressures
and perfusion. He had soft intermittent cardiac murmur noted
throughout his stay but this did not persist and he has not
had a need for any echocardiograms throughout his stay.

Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Enteral feedings were
initiated shortly after birth and he had no difficulty
reaching full volume. He was initially fed via nasogastric
tube but as soon as he was ready he started taking p.o.
volumes and was worked up to full p.o. feeding. He has had no
significant difficulty with this. He received fortified
formula for much of his stay but has been having excellent
weight gain on Enfamil 20 K cal per ounce for the last 2
weeks. His most recent weight is 3665 grams on [**2192-3-10**]. He
has had no significant electrolyte abnormalities and has had
normal urine output throughout his stay.

GI: He had a bilirubin of 8.3 on day of life 3 and was
started on phototherapy. This was discontinued and he had a
rebound of 5.5 on the day of life 7. He was noted to be
jaundiced several days afterwards and had a bilirubin checked
and was 12.2 on day of life 11 so he was restarted on
phototherapy. He completed another 5 days of phototherapy and
his bilirubin was 5.6 with a direct component of 0.2 after
this phototherapy was discontinued. He had another bilirubin
checked around day of life 19 and this was 8.8 with a direct
component of 0.3 which was thought to be consistent with a
baby who is receiving entirely breast milk feedings.

Hematology: His [**Year (4 digits) **] type was A+, direct COOMBS negative.
His admission hematocrit was 51.2, he had a reassuring CBC at
that time. His most recent hematocrit was 35% on [**2192-2-29**] or
day of life 59. He remains on iron 25 mg per ml at a dose of
0.4 mls once daily.

Infectious Disease: He had a [**Date Range **] culture and CBC sent after
birth. His [**Date Range **] culture was negative at 48 hours. He did
receive Ampicillin and Gentamicin for 48 hours but they were
discontinued when his [**Date Range **] culture returned negative. He has
had no other significant infectious disease issues throughout
his stay.

Neurology: He had a head ultrasound on day of life 8 that was
normal and on the [**4-6**], or day of life 30 that
was normal. Audiology: He passed his hearing screening
bilaterally. Ophthalmology: He had 2 eye exams the first of
which on [**2192-2-6**] showed immature Zone 3. His follow-
up examination on [**2192-2-27**] showed mature retinas. He is
next due to have follow-up eye examination at 9 months of age
as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

lobe has almost entirely reexpanded. Very small regions of
peribronchial opacification are present in the left lower lung,
and adjacent to the left hilus. These should be followed to
exclude developing pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart
is of normal size and there is no pleural abnormality.

1759, CK MB of 52, index of 3.0, troponin-T of 0.21.  The
repeat CK was 1491, CK MB 44, index 3.0, troponin-T of 0.23
and the one after that, eight hours after was also negative.
UA showed small blood, trace protein, trace ketone,
occasional bacteria, 0-2 epi, 0-2 red blood cells, 0-2 white
blood cells.  Her PTT was 29.1.  INR 1.2.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, basilar bilateral linear
atelectasis with a calcified aorta, no effusion and no
pneumothorax.

Head CT further verification still showed no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage and no acute brain infarct.

Patient was admitted for evaluation of dehydration, which
received normal saline since admission.  Also getting normal
saline secondary to presumed rhabdomyolysis with elevated CKs
which were trending down with normal saline IV fluid
hydration.  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction given
normal index of MB.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since she was admitted, her rabdo was
improving daily.  She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction, but on day two of hospital admission, she
developed shortness of breath, and she was slightly
refractory to O2 treatments.  An ABG was retained, which
showed a CO2 of 108 with good pO2.  She was then transferred
to the MICU for further evaluation secondary to CO2
retention.  She stayed in the MICU for three days.  Patient's
blood gas was repeated and over time, blood gas gradually
improved.  Although when readmitted to the floor, still the
bicarb for ........... were a mechanism was still elevated,
although decreasing each day.

For the past three days, the bicarb has been decreasing.  It
has gone from 50 to 48 to 44 and today's is pending.  Patient
is still on face mask today, but says that everything is
feeling better, and her extraocular motors are now back and
she notes that she is going back to her old self, although
still has some respiratory distress and is still currently on
BiPAP machine intermittently with nasal cannula.  Her lower
edema, she is wearing her stockings and since wearing the
stockings, had been feeling better.  Her rhabdomyolysis has
been improved and the last CK was dramatically improved from
the over 1,000 CK that was on admission, it was 300 and
today's CK pending.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable, some respiratory distress.
Continues to be on O2.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease as well as Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, who was admitted to the
Emergency Room after being found unresponsive at his nursing
home at 10:15 on the morning of admission.  He was found to
be lethargic.  He was given [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and nebulizers,
without any improvement in his mental status.  He was
transferred to the Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was given vancomycin and
ceftriaxone and intubated for decreased mental status as well
as hypercarbia with arterial blood gases of 7.2, 83, 44 on
four liters nasal cannula.  He also received two and one-half
liters of fluid and was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  2.  Coronary artery disease.  3.  Congestive heart
failure.  4.  Cerebrovascular accident.  5.  Hypertension.
6.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  7.  Peripheral
vascular disease.  8.  Bilateral below the knee amputations.
9.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
10.  Phantom limb pain.  11.  Osteomyelitis.  12.
Parkinson's disease.  13.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Simvastatin, Sinemet, zinc
sulfate, vitamin C, pantoprazole, digoxin, aspirin,
lisinopril, multivitamins, Glucotrol, MS Contin, Beclovent,
Combivent, Neurontin, Lopressor, regular insulin sliding
scale, Risperdal, Remeron, Klonopin, Percocet, Atrovent,
albuterol, Mylanta and Tylenol.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident of a nursing
facility.  His primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a temperature of 104.8, pulse 88, blood
pressure 76/64.  General:  Patient intubated, on pressure
support of 15, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils small and reactive to light, oropharynx
extremely dry.  Neck:  Supple, flat neck veins.  Chest:
Rhonchi throughout, decreased breath sounds at both bases.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, guaiac negative.
Extremities:  Bilateral below the knee amputations, right 1.5
cm round shallow ulcer on right stump without any tracking
erythema or drainage.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 10.5,
hematocrit 46.3, platelet count 151, sodium 142, potassium
7.3, repeat 4.4, chloride 104, bicarbonate 31, BUN 47,
creatinine 1 and glucose 60.  Urinalysis showed specific
gravity of 1.003, nitrite positive with moderate bacteria, 1
white blood cell, 1 red blood cell.  Chest x-ray showed
parahilar prominence, bibasilar interstitial process
consistent with aspiration pneumonia as well as pulmonary
edema.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 100 beats
per minute with a left axis deviation, no acute ST wave
changes; no old electrocardiogram available for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit intubated in respiratory failure with
underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; also,
likely pneumonia.  He eventually grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus out of his sputum and was treated with
a two week course of vancomycin.  He also had a clotted right
PICC line at the time of admission, which was removed and
eventually grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**].  He was treated with two weeks
of fluconazole.

The patient was also noted on chest x-ray to have evidence of
a right pneumothorax.  Surgery was called to place a chest
tube, which drained transudative fluids for multiple days,
and was eventually removed.  The patient also had his course
complicated by self-extubation with several days of
increasing respiratory distress.  He was eventually
reintubated and underwent bronchoscopy.

The patient was also found to have a clot in his right
internal jugular, for which he was started on a heparin drip.
He also had a PICC line placed in the right arm.  The patient
was doing better after a several week course.  However, he
then began to spike multiple fevers again.  He had a repeat
bronchoscopy which showed left lower lobe collapse.  He then
grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus out of his
sputum once again.  He also had gram negative rods in his
sputum which turned out to be E. coli, sensitive to
ceftriaxone and ceftazidime.  He was started on antibiotics
again.

The patient also grew Providencia stuartii in his urine and,
when his arterial line was removed on [**2144-12-8**], he
grew gram positive, likely Staphylococcus, from his blood.
The patient continued to do poorly despite aggressive
antibiotic therapy.  His white blood cell count increased to
27.  His urine output decreased.  His pressures dropped into
the 40s systolic.  He was started on Dopamine.  His pressure
still did not respond and he required Levophed,
Neo-Synephrine and Vasopressin.

Despite all of these blood pressure medications, the patient
became increasingly lethargic, despite also being on
ceftazidime and gentamicin.  His primary care physician was
called.  Code status was changed to ""Do Not Resuscitate"".
The patient continued to do poorly.  An electrocardiogram
showed no acute changes.  A chest x-ray showed increasing
evidence of failure, likely the patient went back into acute
respiratory distress syndrome, became increasingly septic and
unresponsive.  Eventually his code status was changed to
comfort measures only.

The patient was placed on a morphine drip and his pressure
support was discontinued.  The patient expired at 9:35 a.m.
on [**2144-12-10**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  None.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
The patient is an 80 year old woman with multiple vascular risk
factors now presenting with acute onset left sided weakness.
Her
exam shows a left neglect, dysarthria, left sided weakness.  She
appears to have a significant territory right MCA stroke,
probably embolic given her subtherapeutic INR.  We will admit
her
to neurology and do the following:

1.  d/c heparin as her risk of bleeding is high
2.  start dopamine and achieve SBP 160-200
3.  obtain stat head cta
4.  obtain carotid US
5.  will check lipid profile
* * *
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a non-contrast Head CT that revealed hypodensity
in the right subcortical and insular white matter consistent
with infarct.  CTA of the head revealed calcifications of the
carotid bifurcations, left greater than right, without
significant stenosis, but otherwise the major tributaries of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] were patent.  She was admitted to the intensive
care unit due to her need for pressors.  While there she began
to exhibit septic physiology, with a WBC up to 24, evidence of
DIC, and lactate as high as 14.  She was placed on
broad-spectrum antibiotics but her condition did not improve.
She had an echocardiogram on [**4-20**] that revealed left ventricular
cavity enlargement with severe regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD, right ventricular hypokinesis, and moderate
mitral regurgitation.  A chest CTA on [**4-19**] revealed a pulmonary
embolism within a left upper lobe segmental pulmonary artery and
bilateral pleural effusions.  As her overall condition continued
to deteriorate, a family meeting was held.  Ms. [**Known lastname 49482**]
siblings asserted that she would never want to be dependent on
others, even if it was for a few months.  Given her stroke, this
was almost a certainty, and it could not be said that she would
ever recover her independence fully.  This fact, taken together
with her deteriorating overall condition, brought her family to
decide that in accordance with her previously expressed wishes,
care would be withdrawn.  Hence on [**4-20**] care was withdrawn and

The patient was transported, boarded and collared in the
Emergency Room.  The patient was noted to be moving his left
upper extremity and right foot spontaneously with a GCS for
reevaluation at 7+.  While in the Emergency Room, the patient
received a CT of the head, neck, abdomen and pelvis and a
chest x-ray.  A chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.  CT of
the neck showed no fracture, dislocation.  CT of the abdomen
and pelvis showed no intra-abdominal pathology.  Most notable
was a CT of the head which showed extensive facial bone
injuries, including displaced fractures of the anterior and
posterior left maxillary walls, lateral orbital wall, orbital
floor, possibly the medial orbital wall.  There is extensive
hemorrhage inferiorly within the left orbit causing superior
displacement of the inferior rectus muscle and exophthalmos
with an intact globe.  There was, however, no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  At this point, the
patient was admitted to the SICU under the trauma service for
continued care with consultation of the ophthalmology service
and plastic surgery.

The patient's initial past medical history and past surgical
history was unknown.  On extubation, past medical history of
severe hypertension noted.  The patient is a homeless
gentleman with severe alcoholism and history of DTs and
polysubstance abuse.

MEDICATION:
1.  Atenolol, unknown dose

ALLERGIES:  LATER NOTED TO BE PENICILLIN, FOR WHICH THE
PATIENT DEVELOPS HIVES.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.8??????, pulse of 120, blood pressure
170/palpation, 20 and 98% on vent of 600 x 12.
GENERAL:  The patient was intubated.  Patient with extensive
facial trauma, left facial ecchymosis, edentulous.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Tympanic membranes were
clear bilaterally.  Right pupil was minimally reactive and
sluggish.  Left pupil 6 mm and reactive.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, pelvis stable.
EXTREMITIES:  Without palpable deformities, pulses distally
2+ bilaterally, warm.
RECTAL:  Tone was normal.
BACK:  No apparent stepoff.
NEUROLOGIC:  Patient with spontaneous left hand movements.

ADMISSION LABS:  The patient had a white count of 8,
hematocrit of 44, platelets of 161.  Sodium of 142, potassium
of 4.1, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 20, BUN of 7,
creatinine of 0.6, sugar of 166.  Fibrinogen was 348.
Amylase was 176.  Arterial blood gases was 7.57, 24, 544, 23
and +2.  Urine toxicology had an alcohol level of 361.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the SICU
intubated for further evaluation.  The patient's main issues
were his multiple left facial fractures.  On hospital day #2
the patient was extubated.  The patient received an urgent
ophthalmology evaluation, at which point a lateral canthotomy
was performed due to increased intraocular pressure and
orbital pressure and the concern of entrapment.  On hospital
day #2, the patient continued with pain and pressure of the
eye and complaints of withdrawal.  The patient was placed on
the CIWA scale with Ativan to prevent DTs.  After the lateral
canthotomy was performed, the patient was placed on timolol
and Diamox to decrease intraocular pressure.  The patient was
followed by plastics for the extensive orbital fractures, but
ultimately felt that outpatient management of these fractures
could be performed.

On hospital day #3, the spine service was consulted for
spinal clearance and an MRI of the neck was performed.  The
MR of the cervical spine showed suspicion for
intraligamentous injury of the interspinous ligaments of T2
to T3.  In addition, a superficial paraspinal muscular injury
extending to the subcutaneous space at the T2-T3 level,
however no cord compression was seen.  An MR of the head was
also performed at this time which showed no evidence of
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The area of trauma showed extensive
soft tissue and bony facial injuries with displaced fractures
of anterior and lateral maxillary sinuses.  Left sided
exophthalmos again noted.

Ophthalmology continued to follow the patient.  The patient
was continued on Xalatan to left eye q hs, Alphagan to left
eye b.i.d. and Timoptic to both eyes b.i.d.

On hospital day #4, there is still no evidence of entrapment,
although the patient continued with limited extraocular
movements due to swelling.  His vision remained intact.  He
did, however, have left sided nose numbness.  At this point,
the patient was seen by the orthopedic service and
recommended [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 36323**] brace for ligamentous injury at T2 to
T3.  The patient will then follow up with the orthopedic
service in two to three weeks.  He is to call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 108738**]
for an appointment.

As for the facial fractures, the patient will follow up at
the Plastic Surgery service at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].  The patient did
remain on clindamycin for a facial fracture and this will
continue for a total of a 10 day course.  At the time of
discharge, the patient is planning on going to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] House.  Follow up will be as above.  The patient
will also follow up with the trauma surgery service on
Thursday.  Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] for appointment.  Final

Date of Birth:   [**2125-12-4**]       Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 27 [**11-27**] week
gestation male admitted for prematurity.

Maternal history - A 29 year old gravida 1, para 0, now one
virus infection (no lesions currently).  Obstetrical history
notable for bicornuate versus septate uterus.  No medication
used during pregnancy.

Prenatal screen - A positive, antibody negative.  RPR
nonreactive, Rubella immune.  Hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, Group B Streptococcus unknown.
Pregnancy history - Pregnancy reportedly uncomplicated with
onset of hypertension one week prior to delivery, followed
by decreased fetal movement two days prior to delivery.
Biophysical profile, [**12-29**] on admission (nonreactive),
nonstress test leading to cesarean section under spinal
anesthesia.  No labor, rupture of membranes at delivery,
yielding clear amniotic fluid.  No interpartum fever.

Neonatal course - Infant apneic and hypotonic at delivery,
with initial heartrate approximately 60.  Infant was dried,
orally and nasally bulb suctioned, and then received bag mask
ventilation with fairly high inspiratory pressures for two
minutes.  The infant was intubated uneventfully
with a 2.5 French endotracheal tube, with improvement in
bradycardia to 120, and gradual resolution of cyanosis over
several minutes.  Apgars were 1 at one minute, 5 at five
minutes and 7 at ten minutes.  The patient was transferred to
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit uneventfully.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Birthweight was 685 gm
(10th to 25th percentile), head circumference 23.5 cm (10th
to 25th percentile), length 31 cm (10th percentile).
Anterior fontanelle soft and flat, palate intact, 2.5 French
oral endotracheal tube in place.  Neck/mouth normal.  Chest
with moderate retractions with spontaneous respiratory effort
prior to high frequency ventilator, poor excursion with
positive pressure ventilation with Ambu bag.  Good
breathsounds bilaterally, scattered coarse crackles.  Fair
perfusion, femoral pulses normal, normal S1, S1, no murmur.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, three vessel cord, no
organomegaly, no masses, anus patent, normal male preterm
genitalia, testes undescended bilaterally.  The infant was
responsive to stimulus, tone decreased and symmetric to
distribution but consistent with gestational age, moving
limbs, skin normal for gestational age, normal spine,
clavicles intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - The infant was placed on high
frequency oscillatory ventilator on day of delivery with
maximum settings of amplitude 21, mean airway pressure of 11,
receiving 30% oxygen.  The infant received four doses of
Survanta and weaned to conventional ventilator by day of life
#3 and was weaned to a CPAP of 6 by day of life #7.  The
infant remained on CPAP from day of life #7 to day of life 44
and at that time he weaned to nasal cannula 200 cc room air.
Caffeine was started on day of life #5 and the infant remains
on caffeine 8 mg/kg/day.

On day of life #51, the infant had a large emesis with a
significant desaturation requiring positive pressure
ventilation and increased work of breathing with increased
oxygen requirement, leading to intubation.  The infant is
currently on ventilator setting of 24/5 and a rate of 18 in
21 to 25% FIO2 with respiratory rates in the 40s to 60s.  The
most recent capillary blood gas was 7.33/46.

Cardiovascular - Infant received  one normal saline bolus on
day of delivery for blood pressure means which were 24 to 25.
Infant did not require vasopressors this hospitalization and
is currently hemodynamically stable with a heartrate of 120
to 140s with most recent blood pressure 64/44 (51).  The
infant has had an intermittent soft murmur, Grade 2 to 6
throughout this hospitalization.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Infant was initially NPO
receiving 100 cc/kg/day of D10/W and was advanced to 160
cc/kg/day by day of life #4.  Enteral feedings were started
on day of life #4 of premature Enfamil 20 cal/oz and advanced
to full volume feeding by day of life #13.  The infant
received total parenteral nutrition during feeding
advancement.  The infant tolerated feedings without
difficulty and was advanced to 30 cal/oz by day of life #20.
On day of life #42 the infant was noted to have loose watery
stools which were guaiac negative.  At that time, calories
were decreased to 20 cal/oz premature Enfamil with
improvement noted by formed stools after two days on day of
life #46.  Calories were increased to 28 cal/oz and diarrhea
started again on day of life #48.  Calories were decreased to
20 ca/oz again and on day of life #51, due to increased
abdominal distention on KUB, the infant was made NPO and is
currently NPO on total parenteral nutrition of D10/W with
interlipids at 130 cc/kg/day.  The most recent electrolytes
on [**1-25**] were sodium 132, potassium 4.0, chloride 100, pCO2
25.  The current weight is 1235 gm.

Gastrointestinal - With diarrhea that was noted on day of
life #42, yielding guaiac negative stools, no abdominal
distention, stool was sent for reducing substances which was
negative and was also sent for Clostridium difficile at that
time which was also negative.  On day of life #51 with
increasing abdominal distention, Gastroenterology and Surgical
services from [**Hospital3 1810**] were consulted and the infant
was sent over to [**Hospital3 1810**] for upper
gastrointestinal contrast and contrast enema.  Studies
revealed possible stricture in the terminal ileus.  The
infant is currently being transferred to the [**Hospital3 18242**] for exploratory laparotomy.  KUBs were obtained
every 6 to 8 hours, showing increase of small bowel
distention, no perforations noted on x-rays.  Infant is
currently NPO with [**Last Name (un) 37079**] to continuous flow suction with
small amount of bilious drainage noted on day of life #51.
Also of note, after the upper gastrointestinal contrast study,
infant passed a very large bloody stool.  The infant has had only
scant stools upon returning to [**Hospital6 2018**].

Hematology - The infant's blood type is A positive/Coomb's
negative.  The infant has received four packed red blood cell
transfusions this hospitalization.  The most recent blood
transfusion was on [**1-23**], day of life #50 for a hematocrit
of 25%, the most recent hematocrit on day of life 51 was
39.6%.

Infectious disease - The infant received seven days of
ampicillin and cefotaxime from day of life 0 to day of life
#7.  The infant has not received antibiotics until day of
life #50, when a blood culture was drawn due to persistent
diarrhea which showed gram positive cocci which was
identified as coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  The patient
is currently on Vancomycin and Gentamicin and Clindamycin.  A
repeat blood culture on [**1-23**] is negative to date.

Neurology - The infant has had four head ultrasounds on
[**12-5**], [**12-3**], [**12-14**] and [**1-13**], all with
no intraventricular hemorrhage, no PVL.

Sensory - Hearing screening should be performed.

Ophthalmology - Eye examination on [**1-16**] showed Stage 1
retinopathy of prematurity.  Follow up in one week.

Psychosocial - [**Hospital6 256**] social
worker involved with family.  Contact social worker can be
reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].  Parents are involved with infant's

Chief Complaint:
pelvic fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26585**] is a French Creole speaking [**Age over 90 **] M with recent
pelvic fracture who developed aspiration pneumonia and now is
admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. He was saturating well on the
medical floor until 2 days ago when he had an aspiration event
and became slightly hypoxic. This morning, his hypoxia
progressed to the point that he needed high flow face mask to
maintain sats of 96%. Since his chest x ray was unchanged, it
was hypothesized that his new A-a gradient was due to a
pulmonary embolism. A CTA cannot be obtained because of the
patient's renal failure and a V/Q scan would not be useful since
his baseline CXR shows infiltrates. He was hemodynamically
stable at time of transfer.

Past Medical History:

process cannot be excluded based on this chest radiograph. The
left retrocardiac atelectasis and left pleural effusion are
unchanged. There is no evidence of failure or pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**11-14**]: EF 70-75%. The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26585**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male admitted after a fall
resulting in pelvic fracture with subsequent development of a
multi-lobar pneumonia and fluid overload with bilateral pleural
effusions and total body edema.
.
His pneumonia was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
clindamycin given unclear source of pulmonary infiltrate. For
volume overload, he received furosemide intravenously as needed
and he diuresed appropriately. However, throughout his stay he
required an increased amount of oxygen and was on 100%
non-rebreather at the time of discharge. Culture data was
pending at the time of discharge. After extensive discussion
with the family and patient regarding prognosis, it was decided
that he would go home with hospice. The patient wished this and
the family was in agreement.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of CAD, status post MI,
tachy-brady, status post pacemaker, CHF, diabetes type II, and
depression who sustained a left hip fracture after a fall at
rehab.

1. Left hip fracture: Upon medical clearance (unchanged EKG,
negative CXR, negative UA, normal PT/PTT, and correction of mild
hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), she underwent ORIF of her left
hip.  She was started on a 7 day course of prophylactic
antibiotics cefazolin and levofloxacin.  She was started on a 6
week course of enoxaparin 40 mg SC for DVT prophylaxis
post-operatively.  She should follow-up with orthopedics in 2
weeks upon discharge.

2. Hypotension: She had post-operative hypotension that was
attributed to hypovolemia given her peri-operative blood loss
resulting in a 6 point hematocrit drop.  She responded to fluid
bolus.  She remained hypotensive and required pressors.  A
cortisol stimulation test was borderline and she was started on
stress-dose steroids.  She required fluid boluses to maintain
her CVP and pressors to maintain her blood pressor.  On ICU day
3, she weaned off of the pressors.  Her stress dose steroids
were stopped after a 3 day course since her pressures were
stabilized and since she had a borderline cortisol stimulation
test.

3) Pain control: She was started on tramadol and acetaminophen
post-operatively for pain control.  She became somnolent and
unresponsive after 100 mg dose of tramadol.  She became
responsive after a 1 mg dose of naloxone.  Her tramadol dose was
adjusted to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], which she tolerated well.  Her outpatient
gabapentin was also continued throughout the admission for
control of neuropathy in her feet.

3) Delirium: She had a exacerbation of delirium
post-operatively, which was most likely related to the
peri-operative Morphine and Fentanyl administration.  Her
neurological exam was grossly non-focal and a repeat head CT was
negative for acute event.
*
4) CAD/Afib/AS: Pre-operatively, her aspirin and isosorbide were
held.  Her Atacand was continued throughout the admission.  Her
sotalol was initially continued for rate control.  Her sotalol
was held post-operatively given her hypotension.  He Aspirin was
restarted on post-operative day 1.  Her sotalol was restarted on
ICU day 4 once her blood pressure was stable.  She had a
echocardiogram that showed left and right ventricular
hypertrophy with an EF greater than 55%, moderate aortic
stenosis, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and 2+ mitral
regurgitation.  She is not on Coumadin for anticoagulation since
she has a risk for fall.
*
5) Anemia: She had a 6 point drop in hematocrit that required 2
units of pRBCs.  Her hematocrit remained stable throughout the
admission otherwise.
*
6) Depression: Her sertraline was continued throughout the
admission.

7) Diabetes: She was on Glyburide at rehab, but it was
discontinued on admission.  She was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale.  This scale needed to be increased once she was
started on the stress-dose steroids.  She was restarted on
Glyburide 2.5 mg QD prior to discharge.

7) FEN: She passed a speech and swallow evaluation and was
recommended to have honey thick liquids and pureed solids.  Her
electrolytes were repleted as needed.  She received numerous
fluid boluses to maintain her CVP during the first few days of
her ICU admission.
*
8) Prophylaxis: Enoxaparin for post-operative DVT prophylaxis.
She was maintained on a PPI and bowel regimen.

9) Access: a right IJ catheter was placed given her hypotension.
*
10) Code: Full. Her power of attorney is her daughter who
recently was in the ICU and unable to make decisions.  Her son
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 16343**] was also involved in her care and consented for
surgery and care during this admission.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 67052**] is a 1.27 kilogram
product of a 28-4/7 week gestation pregnancy born to a 41
year-old gravida II, para I, now II woman. Prenatal screens:
Blood type O positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive. Hepatitis B surface antigen negative. Group beta
strep status unknown. The pregnancy was notable for an
abnormal quadruple screen. The mother underwent amniocentesis
at 18 weeks which was followed with premature rupture of the
membranes. The amniotic fluid accumulated in small amounts
with amniotic fluid index of less than 5. There was a normal
karyotype on the fetus. There was also question of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease in the mother. On the day of delivery
there was significant vaginal bleeding noted. The mother was
taken to cesarean section. There was abruption of the
placenta noted at delivery. The infant emerged vigorous with
a good heart rate but with significant respiratory distress.
He remained cyanotic despite bagging with good chest wall
movement. He was intubated. There was a significant amount of
blood noted from the hypopharynx. Apgars were 6 at 1 minute,
6 at 5 minutes and 7 at 10 minutes. He was admitted to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit: Weight 1.27 kilograms, 75th percentile,
length 37 cm, 50th percentile, head circumference 28 cm, 50th
percentile. General: Nondysmorphic preterm male, normal
level of activity. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Anterior fontanelle soft and flat, symmetric facial features,
palate intact. Neck supple without masses. Breach shaping to
the skull. Sutures. Mobile. Chest: Lungs coarse and crackly
with equal breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiovascular: Regular
rate and rhythm without murmur. Femoral pulses +2. Abdomen
soft, nondistended, no masses. Positive bowel sounds. GU:
Normal preterm male with bilaterally undescended testes.
Neurologic: Nonfocal examination and age appropriate tone.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1.  RESPIRATORY: [**Known lastname **] had profound hypoxemia requiring
    vigorous ventilation with change to high frequency
    oscillatory ventilation with the subsequent diagnosis of
    pulmonary hypertension. [**Known lastname **] was treated with 2 doses of
    surfactant. He was started on nitric oxide at 20 parts
    per million. His oxygenation continued to remain labile.
    His best achievable arterial blood gas on maximum support
    was a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 30, a pO2 of 323. A
    subsequent blood gas was pH of 7.18, pCO2 of 45, pO2 of
    59. Despite multiple manipulations of ventilation and
    increase of nitric oxide to 40 parts per million it as
    not possible to achieve better oxygenation. Multpile chest
    Xrays were obtained to rule out pnumeothorax, and none was
    seen.
    His increasing metabolic and respiratory acidosis remained
    refractory to treatment with sodium bicarbonate. His
    maximum ventilatory settings were a mean airway pressure
    of 20, a delta P of 44 and Hertz of 15.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR: A cardiac echo was obtained showing a
    structurally normal heart with significant pulmonary
    hypertension with all right to left shunting. There was
    mildly decreased left ventricular function but still
    within normal limits. [**Known lastname **] required extensive pressor
    support in efforts to bolster his systemic perfusing
    pressure. His maximum pressor support was Dopamine at 20
    mcg per kilo per minute and dobutamine at 10 mcg per
    kilogram per minute. Following an episode of severe
    bradycardia, less than 60 beats per minute requiring
    cardiac compressions at approximately 12 hours of life he
    was started on an epinephrine drip. His maximum
    epinephrine dosing was 1 mcg per kilo per minute. He had
    umbilical arterial and umbilical venous catheters placed
    which were documented in good position by x-ray. despite
    140 ml per kilo of volume expansion and the multiple
    pressor support, [**Known lastname **] had refractory hypotension with
    post ductal saturations greater than 40 mmHg tor
    differential from preductal saturations. At approximately
    6 A.M. on [**2147-4-26**] he had bradycardia to less than 60
    beats per minute. Cardiac compressions were initiated.
    The parents were called to the bedside and in the setting
    of the severe acidosis with a pH of 6.52, the bradycardia
    and hypotension, the decision was made to redirect care
    to comfort measures and the baby was extubated and held
    by the parents.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: [**Known lastname **] was NPO and
    maintained on intravenous fluids. His total fluid intake
    was approximately 100 cc per kilo per day. He was started
    on parenteral nutrition. His serum electrolytes were a
    sodium of 145, a potassium of 3.8, chloride of 108 and
    pCO2 of 29, an ionized calcium was 1.29. His urine output
    was at approximately 1 ml per kilo per hour.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE: [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis upon
    admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The white
    blood cell count was 11,400 with a differential of 9%
    polymorphonuclear cells, 1% band neutrophils, 74%
    lymphocytes. A blood culture was obtained prior to
    starting intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin.

5.  HEMATOLOGICAL: Hematocrit at birth was 47.3%. Hematocrit
    was rechecked due to the inability to adequately
    oxygenate and the noted placental abruption at birth.
    Repeat hematocrit was 12 hours of life was 43.8% with a
    platelet count of 200,000. There were no active bleeding
    issues.

6.  NEUROLOGICAL: [**Known lastname **] had a normal neurological examination
    prior to his need for muscle relaxation and narcotic
    administration for sedation.

7.  SOCIAL: As previously noted, [**Known lastname **] had a terminal
    bradycardic event that led to redirection of care to
    comfort measures. His parents were present at the bedside
    and held [**Known lastname **] and spent time with him around the time of
    his death. Autopsy permission was obtained. The infant
    was pronounced by Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 6:30 A.M. on [**2147-4-26**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post all-terrain vehicle
accident/crash.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20-year-old
male status post all-terrain vehicle at roughly 40 miles per
hour.  The patient fell down an embankment which was about 40
feet down.  The patient did have positive loss of
consciousness and does not remember the accident.

The patient presented to the Emergency Department with
tachycardia and hypotension and was given 2 liters of
intravenous fluids and one unit of packed red blood cells.
X-rays at that time showed an open pelvic fracture.   A sheet
was placed around the pelvis and secured.  A CT scan of the
head was negative.  Lumbar spine films showed a spinous
process fracture.  Abdominal CT showed a small splenic
laceration, and the pelvic films showed multiple fractures of
the sacrum with a surrounding hematoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post left hip repair for a
hockey injury roughly seven years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient occasionally drinks alcohol; one
to two drinks per week.  He denies use of tobacco and works
as a heavy machinery operator.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed pulse was 115, blood pressure was 77/57,
respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation of 100% on room
air.  In general, comfortable with pain medications.  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart had a regular rate
and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  The left hip showed some swelling and
ecchymosis.  The pelvis was very tender.  Rectal was within
normal limits with good rectal tone and guaiac-negative.  The
patient had 2+ femoral pulses, dorsalis pedis, and posterior
tibialis pulses.  The patient also had bilateral 2+ radial
pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count was 18.9, hematocrit was 35, platelets were 213.  Blood
urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 0.2.  PT was 15.4, PTT
was 23.4.  Fibrinogen was 136.  Urinalysis showed large
blood, greater than 50 red blood cells.  Initial blood gas
revealed 7.33/44/279/24/-2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray was negative.

Pelvis showed an open-book pelvic fracture.

A CT of the abdomen showed a small splenic laceration and a
small left kidney laceration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On day one, the patient required two more
units of packed red blood cells for a decrease in hematocrit.
The patient continued to have a decreasing hematocrit after
the two units and was given another three units of packed red
blood cells.

On hospital day two, the patient continued to be monitored in
the Intensive Care Unit setting.  The patient was in stable
condition but continued with tachycardia and decreasing
hematocrit.

It was decided that the patient would have an angiogram to
evaluate for the possibility of an arterial bleed.  The
patient was taken down to angiography.  An ultrasound of the
pelvic vessels demonstrated no arterial bleed.

On [**8-23**], which was hospital day three, the patient was
brought to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9694**] to have an
external fixation of the pelvis.  The patient had the
application of external fixation of the pelvis with closed
reduction of the open fracture.  He tolerated the procedure
well and was transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in
stable condition.

During the procedure, the wound was washed with copious
amounts of normal saline and roughly about 200 cc of hematoma
was drained, spontaneous relief of the left side of the
incision.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to do well.
He was stable and was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day five, the patient continued to have a
slow ooze requiring another two units of packed red blood
cells.  Orthopaedics was consulted again, who recommended
that the patient be stabilized medically, and they also
recommended the patient not go back to the operating room for
fixation of the posterior aspect of the pelvis due to the
multiple fractures and the chance of a infection following
the procedure.  The patient received two additional units and
subsequently had a stable hematocrit.

During the patient's stay on the floor, he had multiple
issues with pain medication; at which time an Acute Pain
Service consultation was called.  They recommended the use of
Percocet, Vioxx, and Motrin for breakthrough pain which
controlled his pain.  The patient also had his left lower
extremity fracture placed in a cast while he was on the
surgical floor.

The patient continued to do well following the stabilization
of his pelvic bleed, and on postoperative days 8, 9, and 10
he was out of bed to the chair comfortably.  At the end of
his hospital stay it was noted the patient had a slight
deformity of his left shoulder.  Films were taken which
showed a grade 3 separation of that joint.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9694**] was
consulted once again regarding his shoulder, and his
recommendations included surgery as an outpatient following
this acute episode.  This would allow the patient to use
crutches with the shoulder as it is.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9694**] also noted
that there would be no change in outcome from fixing his
shoulder now versus in six to eight months.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum
was 99.6, temperature current was 99.4, blood pressure
was 126/70, pulse was 100, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation was 96% on room air.  6000 in and 2100 out.
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented times three.
Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Respiratory was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities
were warm and soft with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses.  The incision was intact without erythema.
Views of the pelvis on [**2157-8-29**] showed stable
external fixation with good alignment.  Left shoulder film
showed a grade 3 shoulder separation.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  At this time, it was decided that the
patient was stable enough to be discharged to rehabilitation
services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post all-terrain vehicle crash with multiple

[**2113-11-10**] C Spine CT :
1. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.

2. Posterior disc bulge at C4-5 contacting the thecal sac. If
neurologic
symptoms are referable to this location, MRI is recommended for
assessment of the spinal cord.

[**2113-11-10**] Head CT :1. Stable appearance of right subdural hematoma
overlying the right cerebral convexity and layering within the
falx and left tentorium. This is unchanged from the prior study
of approximately three and a half hours earlier.
  2. No new areas of hemorrhage. No herniation.

[**2113-11-10**] Abd CT : . Possible acute, nondisplaced fractures of
posterior right 9th-12th ribs superimposed upon chronic
fractures in this location. Correlate clinically.

2. No retroperitoneal hematoma.

3. Markedly distended urinary bladder.

[**2113-11-10**] Repeat Head CT :
The right frontal subdural mixed-density hematoma is relatively
stable. There is also stable subdural along the left tentorial
reflection. There is encephalomalacia, left greater than right
inferior frontal lobes which may be related to prior trauma and
is unchanged.
  The ventricles and sulci are stable in size and configuration.

  IMPRESSION:
  No significant change compared to the prior study.

[**2113-11-13**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.







Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84474**] was admitted to the hospital for close neurologic
observation and monitoring of his vital signs.  He was admitted
to the hospital on Tegretol and therefore did not receive
Dilantin.  He was followed by the Neurosurgery service and a
repeat head CT was done 24 hours after admission and revealed no
shange in the hematoma. His neuro exam did not change. His
tegretol level was 4.3. He did not have any seizures during his
hospitalization.  Valium was used to treat the signs and
symptoms of withdrawal.

On multiple occasions he was seen by the social worker to help
assess his adiction needs as well as his families needs.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 84474**] has been doing poorly for many months and his drinking has
put him in a dangerous situation in regards to his safety and
his families ability to cope and care for him.

He developed rapid atrial fibrillation on [**2113-11-12**] with a
ventricular response to 150 BPM.  This prompted transfer to the
ICU for treatment with a diltiazem drip.  He denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting and serial enzymes were
negative.  A cardiac echo was done which showed a normal EF and
no wall motion abnormalities.  He converted to sinus rhythme
about 24 hours later and was converted to oral Lopressor.  His
heart rate was maintained at 74 bpm.

Following his transfer back to the Trauma floor he was up and
walking without difficulty, tolerating a regular diet and
preparing to deal with his addictions problem. [**Name (NI) 3003**] to
discharge he had a PPD placed. He remained in sinus rhythm,
vital signs were stable, pain well controlled.

intubation.
.
On [**7-22**], patient presented to the ED with RUQ pain, nausea and
vomiting. A RUQ U/S showed cholelithiasis without evidence of
cholecystitis. Patient was noted to have a mild transaminitis
and was admitted to the general surgery service for observation.
General surgery note from [**7-24**] states that plan for patient was
D/C if LFTs trending down v. ERCP if trending up. All liver
function labs from [**7-24**] trending down, however, patient
transferred East for ERCP. Patient also planned for
cholecystectomy following completion of ERCP in [**11-20**] days.
.
This afternoon, the patient was transferred East for ERCP. She
received ~1.5 L fluids peri-procedure and was ~3L positive
yesterday. Initially conscious sedation was attempted, however,
patient's sats dropped to the mid-80s when adequate sedation was
attained. There was a concern that the patient may have
aspirated during the procedure. It was noted that she had
abundant frothy white secretions as well. Per report, she was
difficult to sedate requiring 2mg midazolam, 120mg succ, 250mcg
fentanyl, and ~1g propofol. Per anesthesia, she was given nebs

38F with asthma, sarcoidosis and obesity who required intubation
during ERCP and was transferred to the ICU for failed
extubation. History of hospitalization from time of admission to
the ICU stay is unclear, as there is no written surgical history
and patient was admitted initially to the surgical service.
.
ERCP was done including sphincterotomy after baloon extraction
of sludge, no stones.
.
Respiratory Failure -
Patient was admitted to the unit after ERCP as she was difficult
to sedate with desats during a ERCP requiring intubation.
Concern that patient may have aspirated during the procedure vs
volume overload as patient has been several liters positive over
last 24-48 hours and has uncertain history of CHF [**12-21**] diastolic
dysfunction. Could also be due to fact that patient required a
large amount of sedation to overcome gag reflex. Patient was
weaned from AC to PS overnight and then sedation was weaned and
patient was extubated without complication and did not
experience recurrent respiratory difficulties throughout the
hospiatlization.
.
Transaminitis - LFTs on ICU admission were elevated, began to
trend down, patient is s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy [**7-24**]. Pt was
on general surgery service, attending [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 468**], MD. Was
planned for cholecystectomy in next 1-3 days following ERCP. As
per general surgery plan to discharge from ICU to medical team
and then would follow up with plan for cholecystectomy in the
future. unclear what final plan was as patient was discharged
from hospitalist service.  On arrival to the Hospitalist
service, the patient was noted to be afebrile, tolerating
regular diet, denying abdominal pain, and transaminitis was
resolving on serum assays.  Pt. was sent home after conferring
with surgery who recommended outpatient follow up for evaluation
for lap chole in the future.

was extubated. She was then transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. A right sided pigtail catheter was placed
for a right pneumothorax. Unfortunately this failed to re-expand
her lung and her pigtail was changed to a chest tube over a
wire. Aspirin (325 mg) was started for anticoagulation per the
neurology service given her past stroke. He chest tube was
removed on postoperative day five without complication. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged to her
home on postoperative day five. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an

Mother's pregnancy was achieved with in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization
resulting in trichorionic, triamniotic triplets.  The
pregnancy course was otherwise uneventful until the
assessment of intrauterine growth restriction of this
triplet.  A biophysical profile on the delivery was [**1-31**] for
this triplet and that prompted the decision to deliver by
cesarean section.  This infant emerged vigorous. The Apgars
were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.

Service:  CORONARY CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was an 89 year old
woman with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease admitted to an outside hospital on [**3-29**] after mechanical fall.  At the outside hospital, a CT scan
of the head was negative, the patient was asymptomatic but
ECG developed T wave inversions anteriorly and she was found
to have elevated creatinine kinase with a peak of 840.  Peak
CK MB was at 25 and troponin I peaked at 8.0.  The patient
was started on heparin at the outside hospital.

The patient also was noted at the outside hospital to have
supraventricular tachycardia despite beta blockers and
calcium channel blockers.  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-1**] for a
cardiac catheterization.

She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**4-1**], which
showed 80% diagonal 1 stenosis which was too small for
intervention and otherwise mild disease.  The patient also
with left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 35 which was
elevated as well as severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service at that time for
diuresis.

The patient also underwent electrophysiology ablation on
[**4-3**] for her recurrent supraventricular tachycardia
despite medical management.

An echocardiogram on [**4-4**] showed severe hypokinesis
which was new compared to a normal echocardiogram per report
from an outside hospital dated [**2120-3-20**].

The patient also had two episodes of hypoxia while on the
floor which improved with respiratory suctioning and
diuresis.  On [**4-4**], the patient had a witnessed
respiratory arrest.  The patient was speaking to a nurses
aide and abruptly stopped breathing and turned blue.  The
patient was intubated at that time as well as started on
Dopamine drip for pressure support and transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit.

At the time of transfer to the Coronary Care Unit, the
patient was intubated, sedated and not able to answer
questions or follow commands.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Total hip replacement.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Recurrent falls.
5.  Anemia.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, intubated and sedated
elderly woman in no apparent distress with coarse breath
sounds throughout her lungs.  She had a II/VI systolic
murmur.  The remainder of the physical examination was
notable for no edema and trace pulses throughout.

LABORATORY:  Diagnostics on admission revealed chest x-ray
with appropriate placement of endotracheal tube.  No
pneumothorax.  Moderately enlarged heart as well as mild
congestive pattern.  No acute infiltrates evident.

White blood cell count of 8.5, hematocrit 32.  Chemistries
within normal limits except for a BUN and creatinine of
66/2.9, which was markedly elevated from 32/1.1 just hours
prior.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was an 89
year old woman with hypertension and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, transferred from an outside hospital after
having positive cardiac enzymes as well as ECG changes for
cardiac catheterization.  The patient had respiratory arrest
and was intubated on the floor on [**4-4**] and transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit.
[**Unit Number **].  RESPIRATORY ARREST/PULMONARY:  Unclear etiology but
likely due to a mucus plus.  Also in the differential is
pulmonary embolism as well as flash pulmonary edema.  Flash
pulmonary edema was unlikely given the chest x-ray that
showed improving congestive heart failure.  Arrhythmia was
unlikely given no events on Telemetry.  Pulmonary embolism
was possible and therefore the patient was maintained on
heparin drip empirically for pulmonary embolism.

Diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism were not undertaken
due to the patient's renal function and poor functional
status.  The patient remained intubated on assist control and
then later on pressure support with improvement in her
arterial blood gas pattern.

Also on the differential for causing respiratory arrest was
aspiration, however, this was not likely given the chest
x-ray findings.  The patient was still covered with
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for this however.  The patient
also continued on nebulizer treatments.

Per discussions with the patient's family and medical team,
the patient was extubated on [**4-7**] and was placed on
supplemental oxygen via shovel mask and nasal cannula.   The
patient was made COMFORT MEASURES ONLY even prior to
extubation and the plan with the family and Medical Team was
not to re-intubate due to the poor prognosis and futility of
re-intubation.  The patient was placed on a morphine drip
titrated to comfort.

The patient passed away from cardiopulmonary arrest on [**2120-4-8**].

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient with non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction at the outside hospital which
may have been rate related ischemia related to the patient's
supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient was maintained on
aspirin as well as Plavix and beta blocker.

3.  PUMP AND HEMODYNAMICS:  Echocardiogram on [**4-4**]
showed an ejection fraction of 25% with severe hypokinesis
and depressed right ventricular function as well as depressed
left ventricular function.  This was a drastic change from
the patient's echocardiogram at an outside hospital on
[**3-20**].  The obtained report from that echocardiogram
showed a normal ejection fraction.

The patient was started on Dopamine on [**4-4**] when she
became hypotensive during her respiratory arrest.  This was
weaned to off within one day of transfer to the Coronary Care
Unit.

4.  RHYTHM:  Supraventricular tachycardia which was noticed
at the outside hospital, and which was resistant to beta
blocker and calcium channel blocker.  The patient underwent
an electrophysiology ablation on [**4-3**], which she
tolerated well and which successfully brought the patient
back to sinus rhythm.  The patient was not noted to have any
arrhythmias or abnormal rhythms on Telemetry even during her
respiratory arrest.  Her deterioration in medical status was
not thought to be related to the electrophysiology procedure.

5.  RENAL FUNCTION:  The patient's creatinine initially was
in the low 1.0 range, but elevated acutely to the 3.0 range
surrounding her respiratory arrest.  This may have been due
to renal hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis due to
hypotension during the respiratory arrest.  The dye load from
the patient's cardiac catheterization may have contributed
somewhat to this as well.

6.  ELEVATED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS:  The patient's peak ALT of
1200 and AST of 1800 were likely related to hepatic
hypoperfusion due to patient's hypotension during the
respiratory arrest period.

DISPOSITION:   The patient expired on [**2120-4-8**], in the
Coronary Care Unit.  The patient's family were consulted
throughout her hospital stay and agreed with the plan to make
the patient COMFORT MEASURES ONLY beginning [**2120-4-7**].  The patient was ""Do Not Resuscitate"" and ""Do Not
Intubate"" and COMFORT MEASURES ONLY when she passed away.

HISTORY:  This patient's name after discharge is [**Last Name (un) **], last
name Mulay. She is a now one week old former 32 5/7 weeks
gestation preterm infant now 33 5/7 weeks post menstrual age.
She is twin #2 of a twin gestation pregnancy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This mother is a 31-year-old G1,
P0. This was an in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization pregnancy resulting in
amniotic dichorionic twins. Prenatal screens were blood type
B+, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, group beta strep status
negative. The mother's pregnancy was complicated by cervical
dilatation requiring hospitalization from 23 weeks gestation.
She received a course of betamethasone at 24 weeks of
gestation. On the day of delivery, she was found to be 6 cm
dilated and having vaginal bleeding. She was taken to the
primary cesarean section. Twin #2 emerged vigorous with Apgar
of 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes. She required
routine care in the delivery room with blow by O2. She was
admitted to the neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of
prematurity. There were no risk factors or concerns for
chorioamnionitis. Mother's medical history and family history
is noncontributory.

Measurements upon admission to the neonatal Intensive Care
Unit, weight was 1.360 kg 15% percentile, length 41 cm 30%,
head circumference 28 cm 45% percentile.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  Weight was 1.335 kg,
length 41.5 cm, head circumference 28 cm. General:
Nondysmorphic, nondistressed preterm female in room air in an
isolette. Skin: Warm and dry. Color pink. Well perfused.
Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat: Anterior fontanelle opened
and level. Sagittal suture overriding. Oral mucosa clear.
Palate intact. Alert gaze. Positive red reflex bilaterally.
Chest: Breath sounds are clear and equal. No work of
breathing. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No
murmur. Normal S1 and S2. Femoral pulses are +2. Abdomen:
Soft and nontender and nondistended. No masses. Positive
bowel sounds. Cord on and moist. Genitourinary: Normal
preterm female without anomaly. Spine: Straight with normal
sacrum. Extremities: Moving all straight with normal digits,
nails and creases. Hips stable. Neurological: Quietly alert,
positive grasp, symmetric tone.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory: This infant has been on room air since
    admission and through her entire neonatal Intensive Care
    Unit admission. She has had rare episodes of spontaneous
    apnea and bradycardia not requiring treatment other than
    monitoring. At the time of discharge, she is breathing
    comfortably on room air with a respiratory rate of 30-60
    breaths per minute.
2. Cardiovascular: This infant has maintained normal heart
    rates and blood pressures. No murmurs have been noted.
    At the time of discharge, baseline heart rate is 130-150
    beats per minute with a reasonable blood pressure of
    66/53 mmHg and mean arterial pressure of 57 mmHg.
3. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: This infant was
    initially NPO and maintained on parenteral nutrition.
    Enteral feeds were started on day of life #1 and
    gradually advanced to full volume. At the time of
    discharge, she is receiving 150 ml per kilo per day of
    breast milk or premature Enfamil 20 calorie per ounce
    formula. Weight on the day of discharge is 1.335 kg.
    Serum electrolytes were checked on day of life 2 and
    were within normal limits. The infant has maintained
    normal urine output.
4. Infectious disease: Due to her prematurity, this infant
    was evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal
    Intensive Care Unit. A complete blood count had a white
    count of 8,600 with a differential of 12%
    polymorphonuclear cells, 0% band neutrophils due to the
    slightly low absolute neutrophil count. This infant was
    started on intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. The
    blood culture was no growth at 48 hours and the
    antibiotics were discontinued.
5. Hematological: The hematocrit at birth was 44.5%. This
    infant has not received any transfusions of blood
    products.
6. Gastrointestinal: This infant required treatment for
    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy. Peak
    serum bilirubin occurred on day of life 3, total 6.7
    mg/dl. She received approximately 48 hours of
    phototherapy and initial re-eval bilirubin was 5.8
    mg/dl. A repeat on [**2143-1-14**] had a total of 7.5
    mg/dl and phototherapy was restarted.
7. Neurological: This infant has maintained a normal
    neurological exam during admission and there were no
    neurological concerns at the time of discharge. By
    gestational age criteria, she would not require a head
    ultrasound, but the less than 1500 gm, a head ultrasound
    should be considered.
8. Sensory:
Audiology: Hearing screening has not yet been performed and
is recommended prior to discharge.
This infant meets criteria for a screening exam for
retinopathy of prematurity due to her birth weight less than
1500 grams. Her first exam would be due the week of [**2143-1-21**].
1. Psychosocial: [**Hospital1 69**]
    Social Work has been involved with this family. The
    contact social worker is [**Name (NI) 4457**] [**Name (NI) 36244**] and she can be
    reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].
2. Condition at discharge is stable.
3. Discharge disposition: Transfer to [**Hospital3 77057**] for continuing level II care. The primary
    pediatrician has not yet been identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Feeding: 150 ml per kilo per day of breast milk or
    preemie Enfamil 20 calorie per ounce formula.
2. No medications.
3. Iron/vitamin D supplementation:
Iron supplementation is recommended for preterm and low birth
weight infants until 12 months corrected age.
All infants fed predominantly breast milk should receive
vitamin D supplementation at 200 international units (may be
provided as a multivitamin preparation) daily until 12 months
corrected age.
1. Car seat position screening is recommended prior to
    discharge.
2. State newborn screen was sent on [**2143-1-10**] with
    no notification of abnormal results to date.
3. Immunizations: No immunizations administered thus far.
4. Immunizations recommended:
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **]
through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who may meet any of the following
four criteria: First, born at less than 32 weeks; second,
born between 32 and 35 0/7 weeks with the two of the
following: Daycare during RSV, smoker in the household,
neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age
siblings; thirdly, chronic lung disease or fourth,
hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Influenzae immunization is recommended annually in the fall
for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this
age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,
immunization for influenzae is recommended for household
contacts and out of home care givers.
This infant has not received rotavirus vaccine. The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial vaccination of
preterm infants at or following discharge from the hospital
if they are clinical stable and at least 6 weeks but fewer

Chief Complaint:
Mixed respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
CVL

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant
for HTN, asthma, and chronic mixed respiratory failure followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] now admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The
patient was found by her family this morning in her bedroom
confused after possibly falling.  At that time, she was
disoriented and looked short of breath with a ""glassy look in
her eyes.""  Her VNA arrived later this morning and then called
EMS.  Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 4256**]
for hypoxemia of unclear etiology with hospital course
complicated by aspiration pneumonia. She has since followed up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Pulmonary with suspicion for chronic mixed
respiratory failure, possibly from neuromuscular disease,
pulmonary hypertension from dCHF and elevated left-sided
pressures, and kyphoscoliosis.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 96.3 120 120/77 20 97%
10L with SaO2 of low 80s in triage.  Initial labs were notable
for a BNP of 4238, and the patient was placed on NIPPV. She was
then noted to be persistently hypoxemic and then became
hypotensive, and so was intubated. A RIJ CVL was placed, and the
patient was placed on levophed. Cardiology was consulted for
question of NSTEMI given a TnT of 0.04, who felt that the
patient was not in over cardiogenic shock or having a plaque
rupture. She was then admitted to the MICU for further
management.


Past Medical History:
- Hypoxemia, chronic hypercarbia felt to be secondary to
restrictive physiology from possible neuromuscular deficit.
- History of asthma, but has not been treated with any
medications.
- Hypertension.
- Osteoporosis.
- History of uterine cancer resected in [**2077**] without

TTE
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction, most
c/w diffuse process (toxic, metabolic, etc).


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant
for HTN, asthma, and chronic mixed respiratory failure followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure with
hospital course complicated by fevers, atrial fibrillation with
RVR, and inability to clear secretions upon extubation.

1. Mixed respiratory failure/Goals of care: A-a gradient of 145
on admission in setting of likely dynamic hyperinflation with
NIPPV. Patient has a chronic element of CO2 retention with a
HCO3 in the 30-40s since [**2081**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] concerned about a
neuromuscular disorder.  In addition, she has K-S on CXR and
signs of elevated filling pressures with an estimated TRG 45 in
1/[**2102**].  The patient was treated broadly with vancomycin,
cefepime, levofloxacin, and oseltmavair, which were discontinued
when cultures and Influenza DFA returned negative.  Patient was
ultimately extubated on [**3-10**], but was noted to be unable to
clear her secretions. The following day, she was noted to have
likely lobar collapse from mucus plugging. After extensive
discussions with the patient's family, the decision was made to
change her goals of care to DNR/DNI with focus on comfort
without escalation of care. All non-essential medications were
held and she expired shortly thereafter with her children at the
bedside.

FINAL REPORT


HISTORY: Status post aortic valve replacement.

COMPARISON: [**5-11**] /06.

CHEST: AP portable view. The endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz
catheter, feeding
tube, chest tubes and drains have been removed. There is a very
small right
apical pneumothorax. There is new atelectasis at the right lung
base.
Increased opacity at the left lung base likely represents a
combination of
atelectasis and pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema.
Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Very small right apical pneumothorax.
2. New right lower lobe atelectasis. Worsening left lower lobe
atelectasis/left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2167-8-12**] via transfer from
[**Hospital6 5016**] after being involved in a motorcycle crash.
 She was evaluated by the trauma and orthopaedic surgery
services.  She was found to have a left tibia plateau and shaft
fracture, a left foot metatarsal fractures, and a right elbow
fracture.  She was admitted, prepped, and then taken to surgery
by orthopaedics.  She underwent and ORIF of her tibia shaft and
plateau fractures.  She tolerated the procedure well and was
then taken to the trauma ICU for further care.  On [**2167-8-13**] she
was weaned and extubated.  She was transferred to the floor but
unfortunately her uncooperative behavior and nursing
requirements were too high and she was transferred back to the
Trauma ICU for care.  On [**2167-8-14**] and on [**2167-8-15**] she was
transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells due to acute
post operative anemia each day.  On [**2167-8-15**] she was also
intubated to acute agitation, confusion, and poor respiratory
status.  On [**2167-8-16**] she was transfused with 4 units of packed red
blood cells due to acute post operative anemia.  On [**2167-8-17**] she
self extubated.  On [**2167-8-18**] she was transferred to the floor.  On
[**2167-8-19**] she returned to the OR for and ORIF of her left [**1-18**]
metatarsal fractures and closed reduction of her right elbow
with external fixator placement.  She tolerated the procedure
well.  On [**2167-8-24**] she returned to the operating room for I&D of
her left leg wound which required VAC placement due to extensive
debridement.  Cultures from the I&D grew enterococcus sensitive
to Vancomycin.  She was also seen by psychiatry to recommended
1:1 sitters and medication to help with agitation and confusion.
 On [**2167-8-28**] she returned to the operating room for an I&D with
VAC change which tolerated well.  On [**2167-9-3**] she returned to the
operating room for an I&D with VAC change, which she tolerated
well.  On [**2167-9-7**] she returned to the operating room for an I&D
with VAC change which she tolerated well.  On [**2167-9-9**] she fell
out of bed.  X-rays were done which showed no new fracture.  On
[**2167-9-10**] she was taken to the operating room by plastic surgery
for a split thickness skin graft on her left tibia.  She
tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, transferred to the
recovery room, and then to the floor.  On [**2167-9-12**] a PICC line
was placed for long term antibiotics and due to poor peripheral
access.    On [**2167-9-15**] her distal radial external fixator was

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 59-year-old female with
multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease
(on hemodialysis), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hemolytic
anemia (with transfusions every month), status post recent
small-bowel obstruction with exploratory laparotomy and lysis
of adhesions complicated by postoperative atrial
fibrillation, myocardial infarction, Klebsiella pneumoniae
and wound infection, admitted with shortness of breath and
weakness today.

She was discharged to home three weeks ago, status post
exploratory laparotomy.  She presented to the Emergency Room
today with shortness of breath and fever times one day.  She
denies any chest pain.  Also notable for a cough with scant
sputum production and fevers to 102.5.  She vomited once this
morning with clear vomitus; no blood or bilious was noted.
She was also noted to have three-pillow orthopnea, but no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She was taken to hemodialysis
and had 2.5 kg of fluid removed.  She had a blood transfusion
initiated and received approximately 30 cc, but stopped
secondary to a temperature of 101.5.  She later spiked to
102.5 and was sent back to the Emergency [**Hospital1 **].  She denies
headaches, neck stiffness, mouth sores, significant cough,
chest pain, abdominal pain.  No nausea, but one episode of
vomitus.  No diarrhea.  No dysuria or hematuria.

In the Emergency Department she received Lopressor, Cardizem,
captopril and clonidine which was her outpatient regimen.
Additionally, she received her usual Lente insulin and
received one dose of vancomycin 500 mg times one and Tylenol
to control the fevers.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday), and the patient was noted to be
oliguric.

10.  Status post brain aneurysm clipping in [**2123**].
11.  Status post small-bowel obstruction with exploratory
laparotomy and lysis of adhesions in [**2148-12-21**]
complicated by postoperative atrial fibrillation, myocardial
infarction, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and wound infection.  Her
last echocardiogram in [**2148-12-21**] revealed an ejection
fraction of 60%, left atrial dilatation, left ventricular
hypertrophy, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Cardizem 180 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tums, Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.d.,
captopril 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Renagel, Lente insulin 10 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and
5 units subcutaneous q.p.m., Dilaudid p.r.n., and albuterol
p.r.n., ciprofloxacin (prescribed by her surgeon for
treatment of a postoperative wound infection).

ALLERGIES:  AMPICILLIN, BETADINE, TYLENOL NO. 3.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history of hypertension, diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco history notable for a 20-pack-year
history in the distant past.  Occasional alcohol.  Denies any
intravenous drug use.  She lives with her daughter who is
supportive and a nurse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general, she was a
pleasant African-American female in no apparent distress,
breathing was nonlabored, and she was resting comfortably.
She was speaking in full sentences.  Vital signs revealed
temperature maximum of 102.5, blood pressure of 222/74,
pulse 83, respiratory rate 29, satting 96% on 2 liters.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Pupils were minimally reactive.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck was supple.  No jugular venous
distention.  Jugular venous distention to approximately 7 cm,
but no lymphadenopathy, and no bruits.  Lungs revealed
bibasilar rales; otherwise, clear to auscultation.  No
egophony noted.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and
rhythm with normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  The abdomen was obese, soft and
nondistended with a tender left lower quadrant.  No rebound
or guarding, and a postoperative surgical scar noted with a
1-cm wound at the lower edge of the surgical wound which was
open with purulence expressed that was sent for culture.
Extremities revealed no edema, and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally, symmetric.  Neurologically, she was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves III through XII were
intact and moved all four extremities well.  No gross sensory
deficits were noted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION: White blood cell
count 13.1, hematocrit 25.3 (with baseline being 26 to 30),
platelets 380.  PT 14.6, PTT 30.9, INR 1.5.  Sodium of 140,
potassium 4.2, chloride 97, bicarbonate 29, blood urea
nitrogen 22, creatinine 7, glucose 100.  AST 16, ALT 6,
alkaline phosphatase 128, total bilirubin 0.8.  Amylase and
lipase were within normal limits.  She was noted to be Coombs
positive.  Differential was normal.  Urinalysis showed
greater than 300 protein; otherwise, was clean.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 80 beats per minute, with normal intervals, normal
axis.  No Q waves.  No ST-T wave changes.  Compared with
[**2149-1-16**] there were no changes except for rate and
rhythm when she was in atrial fibrillation at approximately
140 beats per minute.

Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure with a small
left effusion, but no consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8260**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2149-2-14**], for ongoing
workup and treatment of fevers and shortness of breath.

The patient's shortness of breath was felt secondary to
volume overload and improved markedly after hemodialysis.
The subject of our investigation was turned to her fevers,
and it was felt most likely that this was secondary to an
ongoing pneumonia that was noted on prior hospital course.
However, based on the chest x-ray and the patient's physical
examination, it was felt that it was related to the purulent
drainage from the lower edge of her wound site.  Based on
this, she was treated empirically with Levaquin and
vancomycin that was renally dosed.

During her hospital course her urine, blood, and wound
cultures results were followed, and they were completely
negative.  This was felt most likely secondary to concurrent
treatment with ciprofloxacin as an outpatient which revealed
these cultures negative.  She was treated symptomatically
with Tylenol for fever, and over the course of the next
several days her white blood cell count and temperature curve
diminished so that she was afebrile times 36 hours at the
time of hospital discharge.

In addition to this, she was continued on her outpatient
antihypertensive regimen with better control of her
hypertension.  She received her normal dialysis on Saturday
and will continue receiving her dialysis on an outpatient
basis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday schedule.

Hematologically, the patient was anemic and received a blood
transfusion on her every month schedule in dialysis on the
second of hospital admission.

By hospital day two, the patient had been afebrile times 36
hours and her white blood cell count had normalized.  The
surgical team followed the patient while in the hospital and
recommended b.i.d. dressing changes to the wound on her
abdomen for the next three days and to follow up with her
surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**], as an outpatient.  The decision was made
to continue the antibiotics of Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q.4-8h.
for an extra six days for a total of an 8-day to 10-day
course.  In addition, she will receive vancomycin to be dosed
at her hemodialysis; and this will be set up by the Renal
Service.  She will be discharged with [**Hospital6 1587**] services for the wound dressing as well as her
daughter to take care of her who is also a nurse.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  In good condition.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  She was to follow up with her surgeon,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**], as an outpatient as well as with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**]
for further issues regarding her dialysis.  She was to
receive [**Hospital6 407**] services as well as
continue her antibiotics for a total of a 10-day course.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU [**2147-6-23**] with fever and
hypotension.  She was started on vanc/levo/flagyl and a
subclavian TLC was placed.  CXR was taken which demonstrated
retrocardiac opacity.  She was started on levaphed for pressure
of 90/42.  She received HD for her ESRD.  The fever and
hypotension were considered to possibly represent sepsis,
although there was also consideration of fever in the context of
chronically low BP.  Sputum has remained NGTD.  The patient was
observed one examination to have a foot ulcer.  Endometritis was
considered.  However, the most likely etiology was considered
the patient's dialysis catheter which was replaced at the same
site on admission.  The patient grew out serratia narcessans and
coag negative staph and was started on a course of levoquin and
gentamycin.  On [**6-26**], the tunnelled catheter was removed.  on [**6-27**]
the patient's central line was changed to a dialysis catheter
and she was dialyzed through it.  On discharge, the patient has
received seven days of levoquine and seven days of vancomycin
and will receive another seven days of each, levoquine PO and
vancomycin at dialysis.  The patient has been abectermic for 3
days, excepting gram positive rods believe to represent
contimination.  She has been afebrile for four days and her
white blood cell count has decreased from a maximum of 25.3 to
6.6 today.  She has been normotensive for several days.  She
will next receive dialysis tommorow where she will be dosed with
vancomycin.  Throughout her admission she received wound care
for her old foot ulcer by podiatry; she should continue to
receive wet to dry dressings on discharge.  She continues to
need OBGYN followup on her history of vaginal bleeding; she will
be given the number for the [**Hospital **] clinic to make an appointment.
 She was full code throughout her stay here.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old female with a
history of auto immune mediated myelitis initiated on IVIG on
[**2150-10-9**]. She presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with 2 day history of
headache initially responsive to Advil. Yesterday she awoke with
severe headache and chills, with the development of nausea and
emesis. She also had blurry vision. Due to the severity of her
symptoms she called her neurologist who recommended ED
evaluation. At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] an LP was performed which showed 60 red
cells and 600WBCs in tube 4, Glucose 62 and protein 114 with
negative gram stain. Fluid was clear and colorless. A head CT
was negative and a CXR showed a RLL infiltrate. She was given a
dose of vancomycin and anzithromycin and sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further
management given history of multiple antibiotic allergies.

In the [**Hospital1 **] ED Initial VS were T 97.7 HR 80 bp 97/57 02 98% RA rr
20. Blood cultures were sent. She was noted to have nuchal
rigidity and She was given acyclovir and tylenol. ID was
consulted with recommendation for IV bactrim and IV meropenem in
ICU setting.


Typically flares once a year with autoimmune myeltis, with 2
flares this year. Over last month symptoms have worsened with
joint pain and neuropathy, weakness, constipation, poor apetite.
Got IVIG x 1 on [**2150-10-9**] with plan for 4 additional treatments

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old woman with history of auto immune mediated myeltiis
presenting with headache now with LP suggestive of early
bacterial meningitis vs aseptic meningitis admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for
antibiotic desensitization.

Acute Issues:
# Meningitis: On admission she had nuchal rigidity and headache
with symptoms evolving following exposure to IVIG, with
suspected adverse reaction to IVIG. Additionally, aseptic
meningitis following IVIG infusion has been reported. Her
initial LP could also reflect an early bacterial meningitis vs
viral meningitis. Although the gram stain was negative,
antibiotic initiation was recommended by the infectious disease
team, as some organisms such as neisseria can be slow to
culture. She received IV acyclovir, vancomycin, bactrim and
underwent desensitization to ceftriaxone. HSV PCR was requested
from OSH LP. She did develop throat swelling at higher dose of
ceftriaxone and required IV  solumedrol, benadryl and
famotidine. The patient subsequently tolerated ceftriaxone. She
was transferred to the floor on HOD 2. HSV PCR was negative at
OSH and thus acyclovir was discontinued. The ID team recommended
a repeat LP and this was done. It showed no signs of infectious
etiology with only 7 WBCs, no organisms or polys, and negative
gram stain. Antibiotics were discontinued at this time. The
patient was observed for 12 hours after and was without symptoms
or fever. She was discharged home with the thought that the
meningitis was aseptic and secondary to adverse reaction to
IVIG.

# Autoimmune mediated myelitis: Pt had acute flare of her
myeltis with IVIG given. She had improvement of myelitis
symptoms with IVIG but development of nausea and headache
subsequently as well as aseptic meningitis picture, most likely
an adverse reaction to IVIG. This was discussed by her
neurologist given that she is planned for weekly IVIG. The
patient was scheduled to follow up with her outpatient
neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**] for further treatment.

Chronic Issues:
# Asthma: home advair was continued.

# Glaucoma: continued eye drops

# h/o seziures: home clonazepam 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with additional 1 mg
dose at 2 pm was continued.

Transitional Issues:
- Patient will follow up with outpatient neurologist regarding
futher care of autoimmune myelitis.
- CSF culture pending.
- Blood cultures pending.

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19122**],

You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] hospital because you were
having head aches and neck stiffiness and thought to have
meningitis. You were transferred here because of your history
with allergies to antibiotics. We initially treated you with
antibiotics. However, we now think that your symptoms are not
caused by an infectious meningitis but most likely secondary to
an adverse reaction to your recent IVIG treatment. A repeat LP
at [**Hospital1 **] showed no signs of infection.

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your [**Hospital1 **] doctors

Chief Complaint:
nausea, swelling, pain and warmth in Left leg, fever, altered
mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
33 year-old healthy male with a long history of lower extremity
edema and intermittent erythema who presents to the ED after a
motor vehicle accident. According to te patient, his fiancee,
and his mother, he was feeling well up until earlier today when
his left leg became painful and erythematous. He remembers
getting in his car to drive somewhere, and then his next memory
is of walking around after the accident. He reportedly was the
restrained driver in a motor vehicle accident in which his
vehicle hit a tree or a pole.
.
He was thoroughly evaluated in the ED for any evidence of
traumatic injury, and had negative films including a chest
x-ray, pelvis films, and left knee films. He had CT scans of the
head, C-spine, and entire Torso that did not show any evidence
of traumatic inhury, fracture, source of infection, or bone
abnormality. On arrival he was noted to be febrile to 104.8,
tachycardic, and hypotensive at one point with a blood pressure
of 93 systolic. His exam in the ED was remarkable for bbilateral
lower extremity edema, and for mild erythema of the left lower
leg with leg tenderness. A left lower extremity doppler study
showed no evidence for DVT.
.
An attempt was made at an LP, but the procedure was unable to be
completed. Given the patient's high fever, altered mental
status, and leukocytosis he was treated for both cellulitis and
meningitis. His other labs were notable for a normal urinalysis
without any blood or protein, a normal serum sodium, and a
normal BUN/Creatinine of 19/1.9. His serum toxicology screen was
negative as well.
.
On further historical review, his fiancee and mother state that
he has had lower extremity edema since age 5. This has always
fluctuated, but has never disappeared. He has also had the
erythema of the left leg twice in the past, and he has been
treated with naproxen and antibiotics for presumed cellulitis.
The erythema usually lasts for a week, and it never goes above
the knee. There is no history of skin breakdown or subcutaneous
nodules. However, he reports having occasional skin blisters
when his edema is severe. he has no history of hematuria,
dysuria, sore throat, cough, SOB, DOE, orthopnea, rash, eye
inflammation, urehtral inflammation, joint pains or swelling,
and he has not had any easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, or
blood clots.
.
His medical history is significant for only his chronic lower
extremity edema. He has no PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was previously treated for
similar left leg symptoms and fever at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital ED. he
has a known right Bell's Palsy, and possibly a history of a left
Bell's Palsy 5 years ago.

Past Medical History:
Chronic LE edema with multiple episodes of cellulitis (two
episodes a year)
Bell's palsy of Left side of face 5 years ago
Bell's palsy of Right side of face 2 weeks ago

Social History:
He works in [**Company 62819**] and is on his feet all day. He has no known
sick contacts, but has a history of TB exposure for which he was
treated for 6 months with one drug (presumably INH). He has no
tick exposure, and no travel outside of the US. He lives in the
city, and does not go camping or hiking. He did visit [**Hospital3 **]
once this summer, but was not exposed to animals or insects. he
does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He does not use IV
drugs.

Family History:
His family history is significant for a father who died of
complications from Rheumatic heart disease. He may have also had
a DVT and an embolic or thrombotic stroke. His mother is
healthy. He has no family history of bleeding disorders, kidney
disease, rheumatologic diseases, vasculitis, or blood
malignancies

evident within
the soft tissues. There is no evidence of fracture, bone
destruction, or
dislocation. The tendons crossing the ankle joint are within
normal limits.
The Achilles tendon and plantar fascia are similarly grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of abscess or soft tissue gas.


Brief Hospital Course:
 1. Cellulitis- His exam was consistent with cellulitis. Other
etiologies such as vasculitis or erythema nodosum were
considered, but were not worked up because he improved with
antibiotics. Initially, he was placed on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone
(at meningitis doses given his altered mental status on
admission) and Metronidazole for broad spectrium coverage.  On
discharge from the ICU, his coverage was limited to Vanc and
Ceftriaxone while waiting for cultures to come back.  However,
he continued to spike fevers and oxacillin was added to his
coverage.  Given his continued fevers, a CK was done to evaluate
for myonecrosis which returned mildly elevated at 223, a lactate
was normalized at 2.0 and a LLE CT was ordered which showed no
evidence of necrotizing fascitis or abscess.  On HD3, he
improved and the ceftriaxone was removed.  He was discharged on
HD4 on keflex after being afebrile overnight and with a
declining WBC count.  All of his blood cultures showed NGTD, and
his UCx were negative.
- Continue Keflex for 11 days.
.
2. Chronic LE edema - This is a chronic condition for him and
likely represents venous insufficiency.  He has no
lymphadenopathy that could account for lymphatic drainage
problems.  [**Name (NI) **] has no protein or blood in his urine which argues
against renal causes such as nephrotic syndrome, though his
albumin is on the low side of normal, but it's a negative acute
phase reactant. A TTE was normal making a cardiac etiology very
unlikely.
.
4. Loss of consciousness - It is unclear from the history
whether he had a loss of consciousness preceeding the accident
or whether he has post-concussive amnesia. With his infection
and high fever he may have had orthostasis or a vasovagal
episode causing his syncope. He has no historical evidence of
cardiogenic or neurocardiogenic syncope. The infection and
critical illness is the likely cause.  He had no events on
telemetry and a TTE showed no structural cardiac causes of
syncope.

5. FEN: He was hypophosphatemic on transfer from the MICU, and
was supplemented x 1, after which he resumed a normal diet with
good results.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
patient, with hospitalization earlier this year for
congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and palpitations.
She has also had several hospitalizations in the past 4-5
years for congestive heart failure.  The patient has been
followed by echocardiograms for her mitral regurgitation, and
most recent echo from [**Month (only) **] of this year revealed 4 plus
mitral regurgitation with mitral annular calcification, as
well as a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 percent.
The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease, a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 65 percent, and severe

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2120-10-29**], where she was taken directly to the
operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], where she underwent
a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 with a LIMA to the LAD and
a saphenous vein to the OM.  She also had a mitral valve
repair with a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring, as well as a Maze
procedure.  Postoperatively, she was on epinephrine, propofol
and Neo-Synephrine drips, and was transported from the
operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good
condition.  The patient was extubated on the night of surgery
and remained on epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine drips through the
course of that night.  She also had a metabolic acidosis
which was treated with sodium bicarbonate.

On postoperative day 1, she remained hemodynamically stable
and weaned off of her epinephrine and propofol drips.  On
postoperative day 2 had begun with diuresis, still remained
somewhat hypotensive on IV Neo-Synephrine drip.  Her
pulmonary artery catheter was discontinued, as were her
epicardial wires and chest tubes.  Her Neo-Synephrine was
ultimately weaned off on postoperative day 3, after which she
was transferred from the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit to the
postoperative telemetry floor.  The patient was started on
Coumadin on postoperative day 3 for her history of atrial
fibrillation, status post Maze procedure.  She had remained
ventricularly paced at that time.  She had progressed well
from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint, although was
slow to progress with physical mobility and ambulation.

The patient had remained in normal sinus rhythm, or being
paced by her permanent pacemaker,  tracking her native atrial
rate, until [**11-5**] when she was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation early in the morning with a rate between 100 and
120.  Her blood pressure remained stable throughout this
time, and her Lopressor was increased, as was her amiodarone.
She continued to progress slowly from a physical therapy and
rehabilitation standpoint, although remained in atrial
fibrillation, was anticoagulated for it, and her rate was
controlled.  She has had intermittent atrial fibrillation
this morning with ventricular response rate in the 80s-90s.
She was going to be discharged today to rehabilitation
facility with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts event monitor for her
amiodarone loading, and she was also going to remain on
Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, she was alert and
oriented.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her Steri-Strips to her
sternal incision were clean, dry and intact, as was her right
lower extremity incision.  She had some edema of her right
lower extremity and some peripheral edema remained
bilaterally only when her legs are in a dependent position,
but she was continuing to be diuresed.  The patient was
scheduled to have a chest x-ray prior to discharge today, and
the results of that were still pending.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin enteric-coated 81 mg po once daily.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid.
3. Protonix 40 mg po once daily.
4. Lipitor 40 mg po once daily.
5. Levothyroxine 50 mcg po once daily.
6. Lasix 40 mg po bid.
7. Percocet 5/325, 1-2 tablets po q 4-6 h prn pain.
8. Continue amiodarone 400 mg po tid for 1 week and then
   decrease it to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week, then 400 mg once
   daily for 1 week, then 200 mg once daily, or until
   discontinued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**].
9. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
10.Senna 1 tablet po bid.
11.Coumadin 1 mg po today, on [**11-6**], and tomorrow, on
[**11-7**].  She is then to have an INR checked in rehab on
[**11-8**], and her Coumadin dose should be adjusted
accordingly for a target INR of 2.0-2.5.  The patient's INR
yesterday, [**11-5**], was 2.1, and she received 2 mg, and
today her INR was 2.5, and she will receive 1 mg today.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 67-year-old woman with a
history of atrial fibrillation and newly-diagnosed non-small
cell lung cancer with left main stem bronchus occlusion by
bronchoscopy, is transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for
further management.
The patient has had several months of chronic cough and
increased dyspnea on exertion.  She also has
treatment-refractory atrial fibrillation (with difficulty
with rate and rhythm control, being evaluated at [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital).  A V/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism was
done as a workup for atrial fibrillation, and revealed marked
decreased ventilation of the left lung. A follow-up CT of the
main stem bronchus with extensive mediastinal extension was
discovered.  A bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-13**]
revealed a soft tissue endobronchial lesion causing greater
than 90% occlusion of the left main stem bronchus as well as
extrinsic compression of the carina and extension to the
right main stem bronchus.  An initial biopsy revealed results
consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.

At the time of transfer, the patient has mild dyspnea at
rest, significant dyspnea on exertion.  Oxygen saturations
are 92 to 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Her atrial
fibrillation is rate controlled in the 80s and 90s.  She is
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
attempt at rigid bronchoscopy to open the left main stem
bronchus.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation diagnosed two years ago
2.  Non-smell cell lung cancer as above
3.  History of positive PPD, negative acid fast bacilli on
bronchoscopy
4.  History of thyroid surgery

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Digoxin 0.25 mg once daily,
Flecainide 100 mg twice a day, albuterol metered dose inhaler
every two hours as needed, DuoNeb aerosols every four hours,
fluticasone 220 mcg two puffs twice a day, brimonidine
ophthalmic solution, Diltiazem 60 mg every eight hours,
Synthroid 0.075 mcg once daily, montelukast 10 mg once daily,
Protonix 40 mg once daily, Ativan intravenously as needed.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  Allergy to shrimp.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired nurse [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Hospital6 1130**].  Tobacco:  History of one pack per day for 20 to 30
years, quit 10 to 15 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with breast cancer, father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**]
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 97.6, heart
rate 100, blood pressure 149/70, respirations 22, oxygen
saturation 94% on 10 liters.  General:  Awake, alert,
dyspneic, mildly uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation, extraocular movements intact, mucous membranes
moist, oropharynx clear.  Heart:  Regular, normal S1, S2, no
murmurs.  Neck:  Bounding carotid pulse, no jugular venous
distention.  Lungs:  Bilateral coarse rhonchi and trace
expiratory wheezes, decreased breath sounds at left base.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.  Neurologic:  Strength 5/5
and equal bilaterally in upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 25.8, hematocrit
35.6, platelets 404.  INR 1.2.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.8,
chloride 97, bicarbonate 24, BUN 13, creatinine 0.7, glucose
127.  Magnesium 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on day number one of admission for
further management of her left main stem bronchial
obstruction.  A rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and
stent placement was performed without complications.  A CT of
the chest done prior to this procedure had confirmed the left
main stem occlusion extending into the right upper lobe
bronchus, and additionally showed a small left pleural
effusion, extensive right ground-glass opacities, septal
thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread.  The patient
was placed on levofloxacin and clindamycin given the
possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.

After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the
Medical service, where she continued to have a substantial
oxygen requirement at rest.  At baseline, she required 5 to 6
liters nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 89
to 90%.  She received periodic Atrovent and albuterol
nebulizer treatments, which increased her oxygen saturation
when she would desaturate to the mid-80s.  She also required
non-rebreather mask treatment on several occasions to
maintain her oxygen saturation.  It was felt that mucous
plugging was partially responsible for this, as her oxygen
saturations would improve after she coughed up mucous.  She
had two follow-up chest x-rays which were consistent with the
prior findings and revealed no interval development of heart
failure or pneumonia.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient was noted to be in paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation/flutter during the entire course of her
admission.  A Cardiology consult saw the patient when she was
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and recommended
initiation of amiodarone and discontinuation of flecainide.
She was rate controlled with metoprolol.

On the evening of transfer to the floor, which was [**2138-12-17**], the patient returned to atrial fibrillation/flutter
with a ventricular rate of 100 to 140 beats per minute.  Her
rate was brought down with both oral and intravenous
metoprolol.  The following day, the patient agreed to undergo
ablation of her right atrial flutter focus upon consultation
with the Electrophysiology service.  This procedure was
performed on [**12-19**] without incident.  The patient was
initially in sinus rhythm following the procedure, but had
two instances where she returned to what was felt to be a
left atrial flutter rhythm with ventricular rates between 80
and 100.

She is transferred to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with plans to
continue amiodarone 400 mg three times a day for seven
additional days, followed by 400 mg once daily for three
weeks, followed by 200 mg once daily.  She is to obtain [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor upon discharge.

The patient was anticoagulated with heparin throughout this
admission for atrial fibrillation/flutter.  She was placed on
Warfarin after the ablation procedure.  She is to be
overlapped with heparin until her INR becomes therapeutic.

3.  Oncology:  The patient had been seen by a medical
oncologist and a radiation oncologist at [**Hospital1 1562**] prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].  She
expressed the wish that she be treated at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
by these physicians, so management of her lung cancer was
deferred.  The pathology from her bronchoscopy returned
consistent with poorly-differentiated large-cell carcinoma.
She is being transferred to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for resumption
of this care.

4.  Infectious Disease:  As above, the patient was initiated
on a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for
post-obstructive pneumonia.  Upon transfer, the patient has
five days remaining to complete this course.  The culture
from her bronchial washings grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.
On discharge, her white blood count was down-trending from
19.0 on the 21st to 17.3 on the 22nd, to 15.4 on the 23rd.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had problems with both
constipation and nausea this admission.  Her constipation was
resolved with a light bowel regimen.  Her nausea was improved
with scheduled Compazine and as needed Zofran.  Liver
function tests drawn the day prior to discharge are pending
at the time of this dictation.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on her admission
dose of levothyroxine.  A TSH drawn this admission was
normal.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Large-cell lung cancer, status post
left bronchial stent, atrial fibrillation/flutter, status
post ablation, pneumonia, hypothyroidism

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair to poor

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth three times
a day, Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once daily, heparin per
protocol, amiodarone 400 mg by mouth three times a day,
ipratropium two puffs inhaled four times a day, albuterol two
puffs inhaled every six hours as needed, fluticasone 440 mcg
inhaled twice a day, salmeterol two puffs inhaled twice a
day, clindamycin 300 mg by mouth every six hours for five
days, levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 24 hours for five
days, levothyroxine 75 mcg by mouth once daily, brimonidine
ophthalmic solution, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily,
Compazine 10 mg by mouth every six hours, Zofran 4 mg
intravenously every six hours as needed

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment
of her lung cancer.


ADDENDUM
Patient was set to leave for [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, howver it was
noted on day of discharge she was noted to be veyr short of
breath and CXR revealed lobasr collapse c/w stent obstruction.
She was taken to the operating room for repeat rigid bronch that
revealed repeat occlusion with tumor. This was treated with laser
treatment but pt continued to have respiratory difficulty. She
elected to make herself comfort measures only.  She was started
on a morphine drip to treat her respiratory distress and
eventually passed away in her room at the [**Hospital1 18**].

Date of Birth:   [**2142-5-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Neonatology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 636**] [**Known lastname 14323**] is the former 1.2
kg product of a 32 week gestation pregnancy born to a 36 year
old Gravida 2, Para 1, now 2 Caucasian female.  Prenatal
screens, blood type 0 positive, antibody negative, RPR
nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, Rubella
immune, Group B Streptococcus status unknown.  Pregnancy was
complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension.  Obstetrics
history, significant for a prior delivery at 32 weeks
gestation but the infant is now 2 years old and doing well.
This pregnancy was marked by multiple admissions since [**68**]
weeks for elevated blood pressure, intrauterine growth
restriction and fetal heartrate decelerations.  The mother
received betamethasone on [**4-27**] and [**2142-4-28**].  Her
most recent admission was on [**2142-5-9**] and she remained
hospitalized from that time.  The estimated fetal weight was
less than a third percentile by a physical profile of 8 out
of 8.  On the day of delivery blood pressure was 152/96 mm of
mercury.  The mother was treated with magnesium sulfate and a
pitocin induction ensued.  Onset of labor occurred after one
dose of Cytotec, artificial ruptures was two hours of
delivery.  There was no maternal fever or intrapartum
antibiotic treatment.  The infant was born by precipitous
vaginal delivery.  She was vigorous and required only blow-by
oxygen for resuscitation.  Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9
at five minutes.  She developed respiratory distress and was
admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of
prematurity and respiratory distress.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission to
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was weight 1200 gm at the
10th percentile, length was 40.5 cm, 25th percentile, head
circumference 25.5 cm, less than the 10th percentile.
Examination was notable for audible grunting with flaring and
retractions, poor air entry, a nondysmorphic female.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat, anterior fontanelle open and
level.  Sutures open, symmetric facial features.  Positive
red reflex bilaterally.  Palate intact.  Neck supple without
masses.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm without
murmur.  Normal S1 and S2, femoral pulses +2.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, no masses.  Three vessel cord.
Genitourinary, normal preterm female.  Spine straight, limbs
straight with normal nails and creases.  Neurological
examination, appropriate for gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:  1.  Respiratory - [**Known lastname 636**] was intubated shortly after
admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.  She received
one dose of surfactant.  Her peak ventilatory settings were a
peak inspiratory pressure of 24 over positive end-expiratory
pressure of 5, intermittent mandatory ventilatory rate of 20.
She weaned rapidly and was extubated to continue positive
airway pressure by day of life #1.  She remained on
continuous positive airway pressure through day of life #5
when she weaned to room air.  On day of life #12 she
developed increasing respiratory distress with cyanosis.  She
was initially treated with nasal cannula oxygen but was then
placed back on the continuous positive airway pressure for
another week.  She weaned to room air and remained in room
air from day of life #19.  She was also treated for apnea of
prematurity with caffeine.  The caffeine was discontinued on
[**2142-6-17**].  She has not had any spontaneous episodes of
apnea or bradycardia since her caffeine was discontinued.

2.  Cardiovascular - An intermittent soft murmur was noted on
day of life #2 and remained audible at the time of discharge.
Four extremity blood pressures are within normal limits.
Chest x-ray is normal.  She is [**Age over 90 **]% saturated in room air at
rest.  The murmur is felt to be consistent with peripheral
pulmonic stenosis.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - [**Known lastname 636**] was initially
NPO and treated with intravenous fluids.  She received
supplemental total parenteral nutrition while advancing to
full feeds.  She reached full volume enteral feeds by day of
life #9 and then was augmented to 30 cal/oz.  At the time of
discharge her weight remains less than the 10th percentile at
1.915 kg, her length is 44 cm at the 25th percentile and her
head circumference is 30 cm which is again less than the 10th
percentile.  She is being discharged home on supplemented
breast milk to 26 cal/oz, 4 cal by NeoSure powder an 2 cal by
corn oil.  Serum electrolytes were normal throughout
admission.  She is ad lib p.o. feeding at the time of
discharge.

4.  Infectious disease - Due to the prematurity and pulmonary
disease, [**Known lastname 636**] was evaluated for infection upon admission to
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.  A white blood cell count
was 6,000 with a differential of 10% polys, 1% bands,
platelets 243,000.  A blood culture was drawn prior to
initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy with ampicillin
and gentamicin.  The blood culture was no growth and the
antibiotics were discontinued.  On day of life #12, with a
deterioration in her clinical status, a complete blood count
and blood culture were repeated.  The white blood cell count
was 13,500 with a differential of 78 polys, and 4% bands.
Due to the further deterioration in her clinical status she
was changed from vancomycin and gentamicin to ampicillin,
cefotaxime and acyclovir.  A lumbar puncture performed at
that time had 1 red blood cell and 81 white blood cells per
high power field.  The differential on the white blood cell
count was 22% polys, 2% bands, 61% lymphocytes.  Glucose and
protein were normal.  Due to the pleocytosis and the clinical
condition at the time there was high suspicion for meningitis
and [**Known lastname 636**] received a 21 day course of ampicillin and
cefotaxime.  Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were
negative.  Herpes simplex virus, PCR was sent and was
negative and the acyclovir was discontinued.

5.  Hematological - [**Known lastname 636**] is Blood type 0 positive, Coombs
negative.  Her hematocrit at birth was 52.4%.  Her most
recent hematocrit on [**2142-6-22**] was 35.4%.  She did not
receive any transfusions of blood products.  She is being
discharged home on supplemental iron.

6.  Gastrointestinal - [**Known lastname 636**] required treatment for
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.  Her peak
serum bilirubin occurred on day of life #6 at a total of 7
total/3.3 mg direct mg/dl.  She received phototherapy for
approximately one week.  Her rebound bilirubin on day of life
#13 was 3.7 total/0.2 direct.

7.  Neurological - Two head ultrasounds which were within
normal limits, most recently on [**2142-6-11**].

8.  Sensory - Ophthalmological examination was performed,
initially on [**2142-6-13**] showing immature retinas to zone 3.
A follow up ophthalmological examination on [**2142-6-27**]
showed mature retina.  Recommend ophthalmology follow up at 8
months of age.
Hearing screening was performed on [**2142-6-28**] with automated
auditory brainstem responses and passed in both ears.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with parents.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male who was in excellent health until on a routine physical
in [**Month (only) 404**] when he was found to have red blood cells in his
urine.  He underwent a thorough urological evaluation at
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital that was apparently negative for urogenital
anomalies.  On [**2193-2-13**], he underwent a CT scan of
the abdomen and pelvis that demonstrated a heterogeneous area
adjacent to the gallbladder in segment V measuring 2.2 by 4.0
cm.  There appeared to be some small cystic areas that may be
focal dilated bile ducts.  No other abnormalities were noted.
On [**2193-3-1**], he underwent an MRI of the abdomen with
contrast which demonstrated an ill-defined mass in segment V
to the right of the gallbladder fossa with associated
segmental biliary ductal dilatation.  There was greatest
enhancement relative to the liver on the delayed phase.  This
was most suspicious for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.  No
other abnormalities were noted except for a replaced right
hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On [**2193-1-22**], a
hematocrit of 48.7, white blood cell count 10.6, platelets
269,000.  AST 27, ALT 20, alkaline phosphatase 89, total
bilirubin 1.1.

Laboratory studies on [**2193-3-7**] showed a hematocrit
of 49.9, white blood cell count 9.5, platelets 267,000.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 30,
glucose 104, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, AST 23, ALT 25, alkaline
phosphatase 90, total bilirubin 2.1, direct bilirubin 0.3,
albumin 4.8, PT 12.2, PTT 24.2, and INR of 1.0.  CEA and CA99
were pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2193-3-11**] and he was taken directly to the Operating Room
where a right hepatic lobectomy was performed.
Intraoperatively, the patient had an approximately 5 liter
estimated blood loss for which he received 5 units of packed
red blood cells for blood loss anemia as well as 2 units of
FFP to correct intraoperative coagulopathy.

The patient was transferred postoperatively to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  He remained intubated at the time,
although was in relatively stable condition.  He did receive
perioperative Unasyn.  He did receive subcutaneous heparin
and Venodynes for DVT prophylaxis.  Close monitoring of his
urine output was undertaken to ensure good hydration.  A JP
was left in the abdominal cavity for drainage of any fluid.

The patient was treated with Enalapril to control his blood
pressure while n.p.o. and on NG tube suction.  Epidural was
in place for analgesia which appeared to work well
immediately postoperatively.  The patient was extubated
successfully on postoperative day number one after a chest
x-ray ruled out any significant pulmonary edema and the
patient made good response on the lowest settings available
of the ventilator.  The NG tube was also discontinued on
postoperative day number two.

The patient was transferred to the floor in good condition.
He was allowed to take some clear fluids by mouth.  The
patient's epidural was removed on postoperative day number
three and the patient was placed on oral medications.  The
patient was seen by physical therapy who felt that the
patient would be appropriate to be discharged home when
medically stable.

During the patient's stay, the patient's liver enzymes
including AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase which initially
bumped postsurgically progressively decreased over the course
of the patient's stay.  His total bilirubin, however,
increased for the first few days postoperatively.  As well,
the patient had a very high output through his JP drain.
Concern was raised for possible portal vein thrombosis
causing a high amount of ascitic fluid.  The patient did
receive a right upper quadrant ultrasound which ruled out any
vascular abnormalities to the liver.

Finally, at the end of the patient's stay, the patient's
total bilirubin did start to decreased and on [**2193-3-16**], the
patient was discharged in good condition, tolerating a
regular diet.  His central line had been removed.  He was
urinating fine on his own.  The patient is being discharged
with his JP drain in place for which he has received teaching
on drainage and output recording.  The patient will follow-up
early next week with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the clinic at which
time the JP may be removed if output is low enough.  He will
at that time also have repeat laboratories.  He is not to
drive while on pain medication, although has been discharged
with Percocet one tablet q. six hours p.r.n. pain.  He has
also been discharged with Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
constipation.

The patient may observe a normal diet and he may observe
regular activity with the exception of he may not lift
anything greater than 10 pounds for six weeks.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient has been instructed to
return for fever greater than 101.0, change in the JP
drainage to a cloudy or green color, or vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
In [**Month (only) 958**] the patient underwent sigmoid colectomy w/end colostomy
for malrotation & megacolon limited to the rectosigmoid in a
combined procedure with OB/Gyn performing a TAH/RSO for pelvic
abscess. She recovered from that operation and was doing well
until she presented last month with a small bowel obstruction
neccesitating extensive adhesiolysis, enterectomy and completion
subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy on [**2201-6-11**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 468**]. She recovered and was seen in clinic Monday appearing
healthy, vibrant and eating well. This morning ~8am she was
noted to be much more ""fussy"" according to her mother and
appeared to be distressed about some lower abdominal pain.
Although she was tolerating oral intake, it was felt to be
somewhat diminished.  She was not experiencing any fevers,
nausea or vomiting, however.  Of note, her ostomy output was not
significantly diminished (albeit somewhat thin) and had copious
gas in her appliance.

AXR: mildly dilated small bowel with scant air-fluid levels

[**7-16**] CXR Limited, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Recurrent Aspiration complicated by Aspiration PNA:
The patient required 3L O2 via NC in the AM of HD2 and was
slowly weaned off to RA.  Then around noon of HD 2 on [**7-17**], she
developed hypoxemia to the 70's and was triggered.  ECG showed
sinus tachycardia, CXR showed some fluid, and ABG showed
hypoxemia.  The patient was placed on 100% NRB and given 20IV
lasix.  The patient responded well and started to saturate in
the low 90's on NRB.  The patient was then given digoxin IV and
another dose of lasix with minimal response.  She continued to
decompensate and was transferred to the SICU.  She was intubated
for hypoxic respiratory failure and started on Vanco/Zosyn IV.
A bronchoscopy and BAL was performed while she was intubated
which showed growth of oropharnygeal flora as well as a right
lower lobe opacification and mucous plugging of the right main
stem
bronchus suggesting post-obstructive pneumonia.  Given no growth
of MRSA or hx of such, she was mainatined on a 10day course of
IV Zosyn for this aspiration PNA which was completed during her
hospitalization.  She continued to require supplemental oxygen
following this slowly resolving aspiration event and was
discharged home with home o2.

2) Abdominal Pain
Initially admitted to the surgical service with abdominal pain
and concern for a partial SBO on imaging.  She continued to have
good ostomy output and she was managed conservatively.  Her
abdominal pain resolved and at discharge she continued to have
good ostomy output.

3) UTI:
On admission to the surgical service, had dirty U/A that was
treated with 3 days of PO cipro (no culture sent).  Her sx's
resolved and subsequent U/As were negative.

4) FEN/aspiration risk:
Pt known to have constant aspiration risk.  She is well known to
the S&S eval team here at [**Hospital1 18**].  A repeat S&S eval showed risk
of aspiration for all consistencies.  She was kept NPO and
mainatined on TFs through an NGT during her stay.  A discussion
regarding the results of her S&S eval was had with her HCP
mother who emphasized that she is careful about having her sit
upright at all times while eating at home and that she has not
had an episode of aspiration at home and rather felt that her
aspiration events while hospitalized were in the setting of her
acute illness.  A family meeting during her hospitalization was
held with attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], speech/swallow team, and
case management.  A full discussion regarding her risks of
aspiration were discussed as well as the option of having a PEG
placed for enteral nutrition.  Her mother [**Name (NI) 382**] did not want PEG
tube placement at this time, but did state that if she developed
aspiration events at home she will consider this in the future.
She was maintained on a pureed diet with thickened liquids under
strict supervision by the RNs along with always sitting straight
upright to prevent aspiration.  The speech/swallow team had
multiple teaching sessions with the parents to attempt to
minimize aspiration.  She should consider bringing her back for
outpatient video S&S again in 3 months when she is healthy to
assess her swallow function when she is home and healthy.

5) ARF:
Developed acute renal failure while hospitalized, felt due to
temporary hypoxia and ATN while being intubated along with
contrast nephropathy.  A workup including urine eos to exclude
AIN and renal U/S to exclude hydronephrosis was performed and
negative. Her Cr trended back down to normal range and on day of
discharge her Cr had normalized.

6) CHF:
Known underlying cardiomyopathy, EF 35%.  Takes Lasix at home
but due to her NPO status through much of her stay and
anticipated difficulty maintaining hydration at home, lasix has
been held.  Discussed with pt's family, recommend re-evaluation
as an outpt to determine when and if lasix should be restarted.


Discharge letter has been written to her PCP

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 28980**] is a male,
71-years old with a past medical history notable for a left
pneumonectomy for lung cancer in [**2139**]; tuberculosis;
pericarditis with tamponade in early [**2149**], which is a
questionable diagnosis; hypertension; hypothyroidism; and
diabetes mellitus.  He presented with left sided chest pain
with radiation into his left arm.  The patient began feeling
sick one week prior to admission with upper respiratory
tract-like symptoms.  He had a cough productive of yellow
sputum, fatigue, fever and chills.  The day, prior to
admission, the patient developed substernal 9 out of 10 chest
pain with radiation into his left arm, approximately 10 p.m.
the day prior to admission.  On the morning of admission, the
patient, at 4 a.m. took some Percocets, which were the only
thing, which relieved the pain.  The pain was associated with
diaphoresis and some mild dyspnea.  There were no other
symptoms.

Over the course of the day during the 13th, the patient no
longer felt chest pain, but did feel fatigue and his family
noted that he did not look well.  He was brought to the
emergency department for further evaluation.

Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient had no
complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or was
diaphoretic.

In the emergency department, the patient was evaluated.
Heart rate was 110, blood pressure 96/50.  He was breathing
at a rate of 14 on two liters nasal cannula, saturating 98%.
His physical examination was significant for no JVP above the
clavicle, no carotid bruits.  He had an S1 and S2.  He had an
S3, as well as an S4.  Abdominal examination was benign.
Lungs:  left sided, no breath sounds, no air entry, dull to
percussion.  Right side demonstrated coarse breath sounds
throughout, mostly on expiration.  Extremity examination
revealed 1+ pulses throughout, warm extremities times four.

Emergency department EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with
Q-waves in V1 through V4 as the only notable finding.
Echocardiogram was performed in the emergency department,
which was significant for no pericardial effusion and
significant left ventricular dysfunction; however, it was a
poor study and ejection fraction could not be estimated.  He
had a normal chem 7 and normal CBC.  Cardiac enzymes were
significant for a CK of 2,245, MB fraction of 105, and
troponin I of greater than 50.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for close monitoring of hemodynamic instability
with low blood pressures and elevated heart rate.  The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course is significant for the following:

Echocardiogram was done the day after admission, which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20%, anteroseptal and
anterior free-wall akinesis; lateral wall hypokinesis; with
all other segments of the left ventricle, which were
significant for hypokinesis.

The patient's pressures remained low during the course of his
hospital stay and on the night of the 14th, the patient was
started dopamine and dobutamine at different times and
stopped secondary to elevated heart rate.  He was treated
then with Neo to maintain a blood pressure in the 90s/60s.
The patient's chest x-ray at this time demonstrated no focal
infiltrate.  However, due to his productive cough of yellow
sputum, a white count of 11.2 and intermittent fevers, which
peaked out at 101, the patient was started on Ceftriaxone 1-g
q.d. for a seven-day course to treat a possible pneumonia.
As a result of the patient's continued hypotension and need
for Neo to support his blood pressure, the patient on [**12-17**]
was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, as the
patient appeared to be in cardiogenic shock.  The
catheterization demonstrated no left main coronary artery
disease and LAD demonstrated 90% proximal disease, moderate
diffuse mid disease, no significant disease of the left
circumflex, and RCA demonstrated 90% mid long disease.  At
the time of the procedure, the patient was weaned off Neo.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  Other interventions
were significant for an LAD, which was stented with a 2.5-mm
x 13-mm Hepacode stent.  The LAD and the RCA were stented
with a 33-mm x 3.0-mm Hepacode stent.  In order to improve
flow, intracoronary Dilt was administered and TIMI 2 flow was
the only flow, which was able to be established.

The patient was started on Integrilin during the procedure,
as well as Plavix, and had been on Heparin and was maintained
on Heparin for intra-aortic balloon pump, as well as his
anterior akinesis.  The patient was also started on
dobutamine at the time that the balloon pump was placed while
in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  The patient was
transferred back to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
monitoring.  Over the course of the next day, the patient's
blood pressure stabilized.  Dobutamine was turned off, and
the patient remained on the balloon pump for a total of 48
hours.  After 48 hours the balloon pump was weaned from a 1:1
ratio originally to a 1:3.  The patient's blood pressure was
tolerated well, off pressors and actually started on
Captopril 6.25 t.i.d. as the balloon pump was discontinued.

The remainder of the hospital course will be dictated by an
addendum from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1104**].

The patient's medications will also be provided by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1104**] at that time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute myocardial infarction.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Followup will be dictated by

Imaging:
Head CT [**3-19**]:
FINDINGS: There is a large mass lesion which appears to be
centered in the
right parieto-occipital region with marked surrounding vasogenic
edema.
Boundaries are not well defined on the non-contrast study and it
approximately measure 2.6 x 3.8 cm. There is significant mass
effect with 14-mm leftward subfalcine herniation and leftward
uncal herniation. There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There are no acute major vascular territorial infarcts. There
are no other discernable masses within limitation of non
contrast CT. There is marked compression of the right lateral
ventricle including frontal, occipital and temporal horns.
Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right parieto-occipital mass with
extensive vasogenic edema and significant mass effect causing 14
mm leftward subfalcine herniation and uncal herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2135-3-19**] for treatment of a sizable right
temporal mass. His primary complaint upon presentation was
headache; but was otherwise neurologically intact. On [**3-20**] he
went to the operating room for craniotomy for resection of the
mass. Post-operatively he was monitored in the ICU overnight. On
[**3-22**] was transferred to the neurosurgery floor. He was bolused
once; for a dilantin level of 8.8. He was seen and evaluated by
physical therapy who determined him to be appropriate for
discharge to home. He was given follow up intructions for the
brain tumor clinic and directions for suture removal.

ovarian cyst presented to ED this morning with acute onset left
flank pain.  Pt had had dysuria for past 5-7 days, did home UA
which was positive, had no insurance so did not seek treatment.
3 days prior to presentation noted subjective fevers and left
work early. Has had intermittent fevers/chills. This morning
noted severe left flank pain as well as some low abdominal
discomfort and distention with associated polyuria, urgency and
dysuria.  Has had UTIs in the past but no history of flank pain
or more complicated infection.  Was seen [**4-13**] in ED for abd
pain, dx with ruptured ovarian cyst. Was GC/Chla negative at
that time.  Upon arrival to ED patient was tachycardic to 110
but afebrile with other VS stable.  She had a UA which was
positive, otherwise labs unremarkable. Had an abdominal CT which
showed a 9mm obstructing left ureteral stone and mild
hydronephrosis.  She was seen by urology who recommended upper
tract decompression with percutaneous nephrostomy by IR,
antibiotics and ICU admission due to concern for impending
septic shock.  The patient was given 1g ceftriaxone, zofran,
morphine, ketorolac, benadryl and ondansetron. She remained
persistently tachycardic throughout her ED stay, and received 4L
IVF NS.  She was taken to IR for placement of a L percutaneous
nephrostomy tube which she tolerated well, urine was sent for
microbiology. The stone was left in place to be removed by IR
once infection treated.  Upon return to the ED she complained of
L flank pain that was pleuritic, radiating to the shoulder. She
had a CXR to r/u free air under the diaphragm or PTX which was
negative. Urology was called due to concern for possible
subcapsular hematoma, recommendation made to watch drain output
and [**Hospital1 **] hematocrits to monitor for bleeding. At time of transfer
from the ED, VS Afebrile, 120 111/44 22 100% RA

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt's a 19 yo F treated for pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis status
post percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, C. difficile
infection, and anxiety.

Pyelonephritis:  Her pan-sensitive E. coli infection was treated
with intravenous ceftriaxone; this was switched to cefuroxime,
to complete a two week course of antibiotics.  She notes a
cipro/bactrim allergy.  She will pick up her antibiotic from the
Freecare Pharmacy.

Hydronephrosis:  She was found to have a left ureteral stone
with hydronephrosis.  She was seen by the urology team and
underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.  This tube
remains in place; she will follow-up with the urology team as
noted, and will undergo laser lithotripsy after her urology
follow-up.

C. Difficile infection:  Her treatment was complicated by C.
difficile infection.  She was treated with flagyl, with
improvement in her diarrhea.  She will continue to take flagyl
while she is on the cefpodoxime, and will complete an additional
two weeks of therapy after the course of cefpodoxime has been
completed.

Anxiety:  She has significant panic disorder, and has not
previously been treated.  During her hospitalization, she had
frequent episodes where she felt lightheadedness, dizziness,
chest/throat tightness, and impending doom; these resolved
spontaneously.  She was seen by the psychiatry consult team; we
offered Paxil, but the patient declined to initiate a new
medication at this time.  She reported hallucinations with
ativan; as such, her episodes were managed with benadryl.  She
will follow-up next week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10166**] to initiate outpatient
follow-up.

She was discharged to home in stable condition.  She has applied
for FreeCare, and will pick up her medications from the FreeCare
Pharmacy.  She will follow-up as noted.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34071**] is a 68 year old man with h/o mitral valve prolapse,
s/p MV repair [**2131**] and atrial fibrillation s/p PVI in [**2135**], on
Coumadin, with recurrence of atrial fibrillation in summer [**2139**].
 He had a cardioversion in [**10-23**] which converted him to sinus
rhythm; however, he was back in Atrial fibrillation one week
later.  He underwent an elective PVI and cardioversion earlier
today with conversion back into sinus rhythm.  He was given
lasix 30mg IV during the case with approximately 2.2L out.  His
case was complicated by mild hematoma in the right groin with a
pressure dressing placed.  He was given fluid boluses totaling
3L in the PACU, but was persistently hypotensive and started on
a dopamine gtt.  Echo was performed and was negative for
effusion. He is asympomatic with the hypotension.  He is being
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and management of
his hypotension.

On the floor he reports feeling much better in a normal heart
rhythm.  He had been feeling fatigued, mildly SOB with some DOE
prior to the case because of his atrial fibrillation.  He can
generally feel palpitations when he is in atrial fibrillation.
He denies any lightheadedness, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LE
edema, syncope.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the

STUDIES:
[**1-4**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness and cavity size are normal. Global systolic function
is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The
mitral annular ring appears well seated with high normal
gradient. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

The patient had pre-liver transplant orders written for him
and had blood on hold for 10 cryo, 10 packed red blood cells,
10 platelets and 10 FFP.  Valcyte and Unasyn were given in
the holding area prior to the operating room.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was operated by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
[**Name5 (PTitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].  Procedure was orthotopic liver
transplant for a deceased donor, PV-PV, CBD to CBD, proper
HA, common HA.  The patient required 7,500 cc of intravenous
fluids, 7 units of FFP, 4 units of packed red blood cells and
3 units of platelets.  The patient had 2 T tubes and 2
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains in place.  Please see operating room
note for more details.  Postoperatively, the patient went to
the SICU.  The patient was kept intubated overnight. The
patient was given Solu-Medrol 500 mg IV times 1. The patient
received Unasyn and also CellSept was given too.

On postoperative day number 1, the patient was extubated.
Ultrasound was performed on postoperative day number 1,
demonstrating hepatic vessels, status post transplant. There
is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Echo texture and
echogenicity of the liver are normal.  While in the ICU.  The
patient was extubated.  The patient received 2 units of
packed red blood cells for low hematocrit and low urine
output. The patient was bolused with intravenous fluids
periodically.  Morning labs on postoperative day number 1
revealed WBC of 11.1, hematocrit of 36.3, PT of 14.6, 34.7,
INR of 1.4.  In the afternoon on [**2146-8-10**], labs were the
following:  137, 5.8, 106, 23, BUN and creatinine 23 and 0.9,
glucose of 309.  The patient had liver function tests in the
afternoon which revealed an ALT of 248, ALT of 577, Alkaline
phosphatase of 106; total bilirubin of 2.1.  Later that day,
liver function tests were decreasing and at 10:12 p.m. that
evening, values were 196, 302 for AST, alkaline phosphatase
of 93, total bilirubin of 0.9. Nasogastric tube was placed on
[**2146-8-10**].  Nasogastric tube lies in the distal stomach. Swan-
Ganz catheter tip appears to be lying in the right main
pulmonary artery.  Again, there were 2 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains
placed that were visualized and 2 T tubes still in place.

On [**2146-8-11**], the patient was transferred from the unit to Far-
10.  The patient was slightly hyperkalemic with a K of 5.1.
He continued to get Solu-Medrol and MMF.  The patient was
continued on Unasyn.  Tacrolimus was started.

Prior to being transferred to a regular floor on Far-10, Swan-
Ganz catheter was removed and replaced by a right internal
jugular central venous catheter. By x-ray, this was in good
position. On hospital day number 7, postoperative day number
5, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for
a hematocrit of 26. After his transfusion, his hematocrit
increased to 32.6.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile, vital signs
stable.  Oxygen saturations were good. [**Last Name (un) **] was following
the patient for his blood sugars. Physical therapy signed off
because he was doing so well.  On [**2146-8-14**], WBC was 5.6,
hematocrit of 26.0.  He received 2 units of packed red blood
cells.  Again, hematocrit after transfusion was 32.6.  PT of
13.4.  PTT of 26.1. INR of 1.2.  Sodium of 132; 3.4, 98, 25,
BUN and creatinine of 46 and 1.2 with glucose of 92.  The
patient had an ALT of 96, ALT of 41, alkaline phosphatase 107
and total bilirubin of 0.9.  On [**2146-8-15**], the transplant
coordinator RN met with the patient to thoroughly discuss and
review all of his transplant medications, side effects and
schedule.  The patient's family gave verbal understanding and
medications were called into the local pharmacy and weekly
follow up appointments were scheduled by RN.  On [**8-16**], no
events overnight, the patient was n.p.o. on [**2146-8-15**] for a
cholangiogram on [**8-16**].  Labs on [**8-16**] were as follows:  WBC of
4.6, hematocrit of 31.0, sodium of 134, 3.7, 96, 31, 27, 1.0,
glucose 116.  Platelets were 73 on [**2146-8-13**].  ALT 76, AST 31,
alkaline phosphatase of 127, total bilirubin of 0.7.  Since
the patient was started on Tacrolimus, the patient's levels
were as follows:  On [**8-12**], SK level was 2.7.  On [**8-14**].2.
[**8-16**], 5.5.  Currently, the patient is at tonight's dose is 6
mg of Tacrolimus tonight and 6 mg of Tacrolimus tomorrow.
The level will be pending for tomorrow morning which will be
[**2146-8-17**].  Cholangiogram was performed today which was
[**2146-8-16**], demonstrating that there was opacification of only
native common duct without evidence of leakage, stricture, no
opacification of intrahepatic duct.  After the procedure, the
patient's diet was advanced.  T tube was capped. If the
patient does well overnight and there are no active issues,
the patient will be discharged home with VNA services and the
following medications:


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace 100 mg twice a day.
2. Valcyte 900 mg q. day.
3. Insulin sliding scale.
4. MMF 1000 twice a day.
5. Percocet 22 tabs q. 4 to 6 hours prn.
6. Protonix 40 mg q. 24 hours.
7. Prednisone 20 mg q. day.
8. Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day.
9. Fluconazole 400 mg q. day.
10.      Tacrolimus depending on the level. Currently, the
   patient is going to be on 6 mg twice a day but could
   change once the level is reviewed tomorrow.
11.      There is a question whether or not the patient will
   be discharged home on Lasix but will discuss this
   medication with the team.

The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week for
follow up. The patient should have labs every Monday and
Thursday in which CBC, chem-10, AST, ALT, alkaline
phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin and Prograf level
should be obtained. Labs should be obtained in the LMOB
basement and labs should be faxed immediately to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 24749**].  The patient needs to call transplant team immediately
if there are any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, any increased swelling to his lower extremities, any
increased sustained blood sugars, also if there is any change
in his wound, any discharge from his incision, any increased
redness to his incision, also if patient is having difficulty
with urinating or with bowel movements. Patient should also
notify the transplant team immediately if there is any
shortness of breath, chest pain, inability to eat or drink or
any mental status changes.

Pathology from liver biopsy demonstrated the following:  1.)
6 nodules of an early, evolving, well differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma, rising in a background of small
cell dysplasia, ranging in size from 0.7 cm to 1.8 cm, 5
nodules on right and 1 nodule on left.  2.) No vascular
invasion is seen.  3.) Adjacent liver shows background
cirrhosis with grade II inflammation.  4.) Negative vascular
and biliary margins.  5.) 1 negative hilar lymph node.  This
is from the native liver hepatectomy. The liver biopsy donor
post profusion demonstrated liver parenchyma with mild portal
mononuclear inflammation, non specific.  No fatty change is
seen. Focal hepatocellular degenerative changes probably
related to autolytic artifact.  No significant fibrosis and
no iron scan special stain.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  HCV, HCC cirrhosis, status post orthotopic
liver transplant on [**2146-8-10**].

admitted to the Medical service on [**2179-3-10**] with a complaint of
chest pain.  She is a 72-year-old female with a history of
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, family history of
coronary artery disease, who presented with chest pain to the
Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, lacunar infarcts, syncope,
appendectomy, cholecystectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy
for fibroids.

MEDICATIONS:   Include atenolol 12.5 mg once a day, Lipitor
10 mg once a day, Klonopin .5 mg twice a day, vitamin E,
folate, aspirin.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   She never used tobacco, never drank, never
used intravenous drugs.  She lives with her husband.  She is
a former restaurant worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Significant for multiple paternal uncles
who died of myocardial infarctions between the ages of 50 and
60.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac catheterization showed high-grade
left anterior descending and right coronary artery stenosis.
The patient was on the Medical service.  The patient, on
[**2179-3-10**], the day before coronary artery bypass graft,
developed a recurrent chest pain and electrocardiogram
changes with T wave downgoing in V3 and V4, ST segment
depressions in II, III and F.  The patient was taken to
surgery for insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump and
started on intravenous heparin.  The patient was transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit, where a 7 French 30 cc arrow
balloon was placed without complications.  The patient was in
the Coronary Care Unit postoperatively.  Just preoperatively,
she was transferred and was stabilized on intra-aortic
balloon pump on pressors.

She was taken to the operating room on [**2179-3-11**] for a coronary
artery bypass graft under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and postoperatively was
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit with an
intra-aortic balloon pump and nitroglycerin drip.  She was
slowly weaned off the balloon pump.  She was on Captopril.
Chest tubes were in place, and the patient was intubated.

The patient had a few episodes of low blood pressure,
continuing the intra-aortic balloon pump.  On [**2179-3-14**], the
patient looked much improved, and was better after being
weaned off all drips and the intra-aortic balloon pump being
discontinued.  However, a hematocrit of 21.4 was noticed on
this date, and the patient was transfused two units of packed
red blood cells.

The patient was seen by Rehabilitation services, and was
doing well with regards to her movement and independence.  On
postoperative day number four, the patient actually achieved
a Level IV to V with respect to her ability to move, one and
a half days after being transferred out of the Intensive Care
Unit and onto the floor.  Her wires and Foley were
discontinued.  Her chest tube had previously been
discontinued.  Rehabilitation evaluated her formally and
discontinued their involvement.

On [**2179-3-16**], the patient was discharged home after thorough
physical examination, which was inconsequential for any
significant abnormal findings.  The patient was discharged
home on the following medications:  K-Dur 20 mEq by mouth
twice a day for ten days, Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a
day, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth
twice a day for ten days, Captopril 6.25 mg by mouth three
times a day, percocet 5/325 tablets one to two tablets by
mouth every four to six hours as needed for pain, Colace 100
mg by mouth twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg by mouth twice a
day.

Upon discharge, the patient's condition is good, and she is
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for all surgical issues, and
with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], with

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Orthotopic liver transplant [**2165-9-23**]
s/p hepatojej and hepatic artery to splenic a conduit for ha
anastomosis [**9-25**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 80598**] is a 61-year-old man with hepatocellular
carcinoma and liver cirrhosis who is being admitted for
orthotopic liver transplant.  He was well until about three or
four years ago when an ultrasound demonstrated liver cirrhosis.
This was presumably due to fatty liver disease in association
with a markedly elevated triglycerdes of 25 years.  Patient was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2165-3-20**] for work-up of bleeding
esophageal varices which were banded in [**2165-1-20**] at an
outside hospital.  In [**2165-3-20**], a RUQ ultrasound was obtained
which showed a 2-cm lesion in left lobe of liver.  MRI
demonstrated two highly suspicious liver masses that could
represent hepatocellular.  On [**2165-5-29**] Mr. [**Known lastname 80598**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
radiofrequency ablation and biopsy of two left liver lobe
lesions.  He was added to the waiting list [**2165-6-27**] with a
calculated MELD score of 8; an additional 14 points were awarded
due to the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, for a total
MELD
score of 22.  Subsequent, post-ablative CT scans have shown no
recurrence of cancer.

Patient is Hepatitis B negative.

Of note, several EGDs have been performed with the most recent
on
[**2165-9-5**] which demonstrated:
Three cords Grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Ulcerated polyps in the antrum (biopsy)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname 80598**] had an Orthotopic livet transplant. First post
operative day his duplex did not show good flow in the hepatic
artery . It was repeated the following day and the Duplex failed
to demonstrate intrahepatic arterial flow in the left and right
lobes, nor any flow in the porta with only a partial signal seen
well away from the liver hilum, suggesting severe stenosis or
oclusion. Portal and hepatic venous flow was normal . He was
taken back to the operating room

Procedure done:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Revision of hepatic artery anastomosis.
3. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
4. Liver biopsy.
5. Intraoperative ultrasound.

Post op he was on a heparin gtt. He did well. Was extubated with
[**Last Name **] problem and transferred to the floor. Events  on the floor
were
1) Heparin gtt was transitioned to Coumadin
2) Slowly drifting down of Hct  so he was transfused a couple of
units PRBC after much discussion it was decided to stop the
anticoagulation as the hepatic artery anastomosis was revised
3) He had a hepatico jejunostomy so he was NPO for 3-4 days
after which his diet was slowly advanced
4) He received HBIG vaccines in addition to monitoring Hep B Ab
titers
5) His immunosuppresive medication was managed per protocol.
6) He had some loose bowel movement but CDiff was negative.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Global systolic function
is good (?inferior hypokinesis). There is abnormal septal motion
c/w post op or IVCD or paced rhythm. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve is grossly normal in morphology. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve is normal Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and global systolic function. Right ventricular
cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Compared with the pre-operative study of [**2150-8-12**], the left
ventricular cavity is smaller and the severity of mitral
regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and estimated PA
systolic pressure are higher.

Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20-year-old
male who fell off a second story balcony while drinking and
had positive loss of consciousness.  He landed with his head
first on a dirt surface.  The patient was awake but combative
on transfer.  He was hemodynamically stable on arrival to the
hospital.

Upon arrival, the patient had no complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of schizophrenia with
psychiatric hospitalizations.  Bipolar disorder.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On arrival pulse was
110, blood pressure 134/70, oxygen saturation 92% on 2 L.
General:  The patient was combative and intoxicated.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements full.  Tympanic membranes were clear.
The patient's trachea was midline.  Neck:  The patient's neck
was in a hard collar.  He complained of no midline neck
tenderness.  Chest:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Good bowel sounds.  Back:  No
step-offs or tenderness.  Rectal:  Normal tone.  Heme
negative.  Extremities:  Without deformity.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 147, potassium 4.1; white count 4.2,
hematocrit 37.6; INR 1.1; amylase 51; serum ethanol 277.

Initial radiologic studies showed no fracture on chest or
pelvic x-ray.  The patient's head CT was negative for
intracerebral hemorrhage, and his cervical spine CT with a
also negative for fracture.  Abdominal and pelvic CT was
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  For agitation in the Emergency Room, the
patient was intubated.  Additionally, he was vomiting.
Following intubation and his initial resuscitation, the
patient was transferred to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit.
He was transferred intubated and was sedated on Propofol.

Over night from hospital day 1 to hospital day 2, the patient
did well.  He remained hemodynamically stable.  His alcohol
level was allowed to decline.  On the morning of hospital day
#2, the patient was extubated without difficulty.  He
tolerated the wean without difficulty.

Following extubation, the patient's cervical spine was
cleared clinically.  The hard collar was removed.
Additionally on hospital day #2, the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor.

Given the patient had a past medical history of bipolar
disorder and known suicide attempts, the Psychiatry Service
was consulted. In their work-up, it was felt that this
current episode was not an attempt by the patient to hurt
himself in the context of ethanol intoxication.  Psychiatric
Service recommended a voluntary hospitalization to a
psychiatric facility for alcohol treatment, given the
patient's recent drinking history and inability to hold a
job.  For full details, refer to the psychiatric CCC
........... record.

Over night from hospital day #2 to hospital day #3, the
patient did well.  He was able to tolerate a regular diet and
ambulate without difficulty.  On hospital day #3, the patient
only complained of some mild right scapular pain, and at that
time x-ray demonstrated no fracture.

On hospital day #3, after discussion with the family, the
patient agreed to a voluntary inpatient psychiatric hospital
stay.  At this time, the Psychiatric case manager arranged
for the patient to be transferred to a psychiatric facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Alcohol intoxication.
2.  Fall from second story.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  In past medical history as listed
above.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol 350-650 p.o. q.4-6 hours
p.r.n. pain, Vicodin [**1-8**] tab p.o. q.4-6 hours p.r.n. pain for
a total dose of Tylenol not to exceed 4 g q.d., the patient
should be placed on a CIWA scale for alcohol withdraw at the
discretion of the patient's psychiatric facility.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the above procedure.  For full details
please see the separately dictated operative note.  The patient
progressed well post-operatively.  She was kept on bedrest with
the head of bed flat for 48 hours postoperatively due to dural
tear that was repaired.  A drain was utilized and was d/c'ed
when output had tapered down.  Peri-operative antibiotics were
utilized for 24 hrs.  Post-operative pain was controlled with IV
followed by PO medications.  Diet was advanced without
complication.  Physical therapy was consulted for assistance
with mobilization.

During PT, patient had syncopal episode.  Complete workup
revealed no evidence of cardiac compromise (normal enzymes,
EKG).  CT chest revealed subsegmental PE.  Medicine was
consulted and recommended treatment with 3 months of
anticoagulation.

Patient was begun on coumadin bridged by heparain gtt.  Once she
was therapeutic, heparin was discontinued and patient was
maintained on coumadin with goal INR [**3-20**].  Given her complicated
post-operative course, she was deemed most appropriate for
transfer to an extended care facility.  INR should be closely
monitored and coumadin adjusted to the target range, and PT
should be continued at the facility.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) MSSA endocarditis: The patient responded well initially to
fluid boluses, and was no longer hypotensive on transfer to the
floor. The most likely source of infection is her AVF.  [**1-17**]
bottles positive for GPC, ultimately growing out MSSA. She was
treated with gentamycin and vanocmycin given PCN allergy and
ease of dosing at diaylsis.  TTE revealed calcification on AV
suggestive of prior endocarditis. TEE showed possible aortic
vegitation with mural thrombus in aorta and aneurysm and
possible left atrial clot.  Chest CT was perfermed to evaluate
aneurysm and showed no change in aneurysm from prior studies.
Pt was noted to have this in past and has refused any surgery or
stenting.  RUE ultrasound showed no evidence of clot in AV
fistula to suggest source of infection.  Pt refused
anti-coagulation for [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] despite risk for CVA and hence MRI
head was defered.  She was dischared on 6 weeks of vancomycin
and gentamycin until cultures of [**2170-7-9**] are negative.
.
2) NSTEMI: The patient had a NSTEMI on admission, with peak
troponin of 11.68. This NSTEMI was likely related to her sepsis.
 Her troponin then trended down. Cardiology was consulted and
recommended conservative managment with ASA and beta blocker.
Pt was not anti-coagulated.
.
3) TRANSAMINITIS: etiology of transaminitis was unclear.  viral
serologies were negative but likely [**1-17**] to some enzyme leakage
from her myocardial injury as well as sepsis.  The enzymes
continued to trend downward during the hospital course.
.
4) DNR/DNI. Confirmed with patient.

CT abd pelvis:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with some associated bibasilar
atelectasis.

2. Ascites within the peritoneal cavity, in the pelvis and
adjacent to the liver and gallbladder.

3. A right-sided ureteric stent is present, extending from the
right renal pelvis to the bladder. No hydronephrosis identified
bilaterally. A hypodense lesion is seen in the right kidney,
likely representing a renal cyst.

4. There are no discrete focal fluid collections with areas of
rim enhancement to suggest abscesses or othersignificant signs
of infection.

CXR: Improving multifocal pulmonary opacities, most likely due
to provided history of pneumonia and ARDS


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:

She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for treatment of sepsis, presumed
urinary source.  She was initially treated with Zosyn and Cipro,
agressive IV hydration and pressor support.  She was intubated
secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure on [**12-4**], felt to be
likely ARDS.  Urology was consulted and requested STU which
revealed a well positioned ureteral stent without hydro or
extravasation of contrast.  She responded to treatment initially
with WBC decreasing from 35.2 at maximum to 14.2 on [**12-6**].  A
urine culture from OSH grew E-coli and abx changed to
ceftriaxone on [**12-5**].  She then spiked a fever to 101.8-102.2 on
[**12-6**] and [**12-7**] and WBC began to rise again.  All [**Hospital1 18**]
cultures, including C-diff remained negative.  Antibiotics
changed to Vanco, Gent, Ceftriaxone to treat possible VAP.  On
[**12-8**], successfully extubated with decreasing O2 requirement.
Currently afebrile, HD stable of pressors, oxygenating well on
2L N/C and awaiting transfer to floor.

1. Respiratory failure - patient extubated on [**12-8**] and doing
well with decreasing O2 requirement.  Remains mildy tachypneic
but comfortable.    Pleural fluid without growth to date. O2 was
weaned over next few days. Ultimately changed to levoquin PO as
wt ct came down. PCP to follow up bld cx.

2. Leukocytosis - WBC rising from 14 on [**12-6**] to 29.9 today with
10% bands yesterday.  Source not entirely clear as blood,
sputum, urine cultures NGTD.  Pneumonia possible.  No diarrhea
to suggest C-Diff. Abx cont and then changed once WBC ct
improved. CXR and UA did not show an explanation for the course.


3. Urosepsis - Ecoli grew in urine culture from OSH.  HD stable
and now afebrile. Recommended cont abx.

4. Nephrolithiasis: pt now with ureteral stent and ? passage of
stone.  Urology following.  Recent Abd CT demonstrates ureteral
stent is in good location with no hydronephrosis, delay in
excretion or extravasation of fluid.  No need for intervention
currently.  Urology f/u as outpt

5. Renal function - back to baseline.

6.  Psychiatry
Pt will be started back on fluoxetine and clozaril now that she
is successfully extubated cont clozaril at 25mg/day and titrate
up to 125 mg per psych with f/u .

7.  Anemia - HCT stable. Will need a repeat diff as outpt.

8. F/E/N - taking good clears now.  Encourage PO diet.  Has had
some vomiting after drinking so monitor for signs of swallow
dysfuncion s/p intubation. Repleted K+

9. Dispo - home afebrile improved

Brief Hospital Course:
89-year-old woman with PMH HTN, Afib, decubitus ulcers,
presenting with bradycardia, shortness of breath, hypotension,
and septic shock likely from a) gram positive cocci [**2-19**]
decubitus ulcers b) urosepsis c) pneumonia.
.
The patient initially was resuscitated with IVF's and started on
broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftazadime, and
flagyl.  Central venous access was initiated to monitor CVP per
sepsis goal directed therapy guidelines.  The patient presented
with do not resuscitate / do not intubate advanced directives.
Patient was supported with oxygen by nasal cannulae.
Bradycardia was resolved with atropine and hypotension was
treated with dopamine iv infusion.
.
Family, including son and daughter, were notified and came to
the hospital.  Discussions were engaged regarding ulimate goals
of care.  The decision was made to provide comfort measures only
and to withdraw active treatment of ultimate pathology.
Pressors and antibiotics were discontinued, and within 45
minutes the patient passed secondary to cardiac arrest.
.
The patient was pronounced dead at 12:51pm and arrangements were
made for burial proceedings with the family.

predominant in the lung apices. Atypical infection vs.
aspiration are diagnostic considerations.
.
ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical

excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function.
Limited study.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 year-old female with a history of recent dental
procedure who presents with rapid progression of sepsis with
multiorgan failure
.
Plan:
# Sepsis - Thought most likely to be due to Toxic Shock
syndrome.  Patient intially had elevating Pressor requirement
with cold extremities.  No cultures grew microbes either here or
at [**Hospital3 7571**]hospital.  By day 2 of hospitalization she was
in fulminant DIC with multiple organ failure.  Her skin began to
necrose and peel away.  Her perioral area also became cyanotic
and necrotic.  By day 3 of hospital stay, family decided to make
patient CMO.  She was extubated and expired within 1 hour.
.
#. Hemorrhagic bullae:  Patient with nearly 50% of total surface
area involved
.
#. Metabolic acidosis: Profound acidosis in the setting of
elevated lactate with likely sepsis and some respiratory
compensation. Treated with bicarb without resolution.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure: Elevated BUN and creatinine.   Per
renal, she not a CVVH or HD candidate.
.
#. NSTEMI: Pt with elevated CK and troponin, EKG with
non-specific changes, consistent with NSTEMI, likely secondary
to shock and hypoperfusion.
.
#. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK at [**Numeric Identifier 2596**].
.
#. Transaminitis: ALT/AST elevated; normal alk phos and T bili,
so likely related to shock liver.

This is a summary of events up to [**2156-1-2**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute leukemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 20 year-old male with
no significant past medical history who was in his usual
state of health until eight days prior to admission when he
noticed some dysuria and frequency.  He also had noted
enlarging groin lymph nodes, which he thought was related to
a urinary tract infection.  He had denied fevers or sweats.
He had gone to his school's health center where he also had
some neck lumps.  He was given Bactrim for a ten day course.
About two days prior to admission the patient had a bowel
movement and was straining on the toilet.  He subsequently
noticed that a black eye developed over his right eye after
the bowel movement and then a blind spot developed about ""5
degrees off to the right"" in his right eye.  He then
presented to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department where he
was found to have a white count of 430,000 with 94% blasts.
His platelet count was 40,000 and the patient did have a
normal head CT there.  He initially received some hydroxyurea
with Allopurinol to decrease the white count.  He was also
placed on Ceftazidime for a fever to 101.8 and neutropenia.
His white count did decrease to 296,000 on hydroxyurea.  He
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for emergent leukophoresis and management of acute leukemia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Undescended testes status post repair.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Bactrim.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM [**Hospital3 **]:  1.  Ceftazidime 2
grams intravenous q 12.  2.  Allopurinol 600 mg po q day.  3.
Hydroxyurea 2 grams po b.i.d.  4.  Percocet prn.  5.  Ambien
prn.  6.  Zofran prn.  7.  Intravenous fluids.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an art student who lives in
[**Hospital1 3494**].  He has a girlfriend and a supportive social
network of friends.  [**Name (NI) **] drinks 12 to 24 beers a week.  He did
endorse some cocaine usage about weekly.  There is no history
of intravenous drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.6.  Blood
pressure 130 to 145/50 to 60.  Heart rate 71.  Respiratory
rate 11.  97% on room air.  In general, the patient is a
young healthy appearing male in no acute distress, lying in
bed with a right internal jugular catheter in place.  His
HEENT examination is significant for periorbital ecchymosis
over the right orbit with scleral hemorrhage evident in the
right eye.  His neck showed large approximately 8 cm nodes in
the anterior cervical region as well as submental cervical
nodes.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm
with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His abdomen was notable
for some splenomegaly, but was otherwise soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  His groin revealed
some inguinal adenopathy bilaterally as well as right
pressure dressing was intact with a Quinton catheter had been
for phoresis.  Extremities showed no pedal edema and warm and
well perfuse extremities without rash.  Neurological
examination reveals a central blind spot only in the right
eye with maintained peripheral vision.  His cranial nerves
are otherwise intact with motor examination revealing 5 out
of 5 strength in all four extremities.

LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION FROM [**Hospital3 **]:  White blood
cell count [**Pager number **] with a hematocrit of 26.3, platelets of 30.
Chem 7 notable for a creatinine of 1.8 and a potassium of
2.4.  His LDH was elevated at 3950.  His alkaline phosphatase
was elevated at 231.  In addition, after several days in the
Intensive Care Unit laboratories upon transfer to Four
[**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] are as follows:  White blood cell count 0.8,
hematocrit 21.7, platelets 27, chem 7 was normal and notable
for a creatinine of 0.7, INR of 1.7, PT 15.9, PTT 26.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Acute leukemia:  Because of the high
white count of 430,000, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for acute phoresis for
management of leukostasis.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and did notice some improvement in breathing.
The patient stated he felt very anxious due to some tightness
in his chest.  He maintained O2 saturations in the low 90s on
room air and had to be placed on 2 liters.  He experienced
great improvement with phoresis, but also received a lot of
intravenous fluids.  He had O2 saturations on the fourth
hospital day in the 80s on 50% FIO2 face mask.  However,
after some diuresis the patient responded very well with
brisk urine output and room air sats of approximately 95%.
He was also started on Idarubicin and ARA-C based on his
peripheral smear and flow cytometry results.  This
demonstrated acute myelogenous leukemia of M4 type.  He was
put on Cefepime instead of Ceftazidime for initial fever and
neutropenia. On the second hospital day he did spike a
temperature greater then 101 and was recultured with
Vancomycin added on the regimen.  The patient had a good
response to chemotherapy and his white blood cell count
decreased.  There was no evidence of tumor lysis during his
hospital course in the Intensive Care Unit.  He did have
acute renal failure, which was thought due to lysis on
kidney, which could be a complication of his acute leukemia.
He had mild evidence for disseminated intravascular
coagulation, but he had no bleeding from any sites on his
body.  He was transfused with fresh frozen plasma and
cryoprecipitate as needed.

2.  Fever and neutropenia:  At this time the patient's blood
cultures have been entirely negative.  An initial blood
culture, which was showing a gram stain positive for gram
positive coxae was retracted due to negative confirmatory
test in the microbiology laboratory.  Therefore his
Vancomycin was discontinued and at the time of this
dictation the patient is still on Cefepime.  He has had no
further febrile episodes.

3.  Acute renal failure:  Again as stated the patient
presented with a creatinine of 1.8, which is felt to be due
to lysis on kidney.  He was aggressively hydrated and was not
started on a bicarbonate drip per renal recommendations
unless his phosphate had become very elevated.  His renal
failure resolved with aggressive hydration and was normal by
the time he was transferred to the Four [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] Bone Marrow
Transplant Unit.

4.  Bleeding:  The patient did have some episodes of bleeding
with the placement of the right internal jugular catheter as
well as a right groin Quinton catheter for phoresis.  The
Quinton catheter was discontinued on the day prior to
transfer to Four [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] as there was no further need for
phoresis.  Pressure was held as well as the pressure dressing
applied.  He experienced no bleeding complications from the
removal of the Quinton catheter.  The right internal jugular
vein catheter continued to do well and function well after
the patient's coagulation parameters became normal.

The rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be dictated at
a later date as a discharge summary addendum.

Date of Birth:   [**2164-6-9**]       Sex:  M

Service: NEONATOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 12225**] [**Known lastname 48080**] is the former
1.63-kilogram product of a 31 and 3/7 weeks gestation
pregnancy born to a 37-year-old gravida 3, para 1 (to 2)
woman.

Prenatal screens revealed blood type O positive, antibody
negative, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, Rubella immune, group B strep
status negative.

PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:  Obstetric history was significant
for spontaneous rupture of membranes which occurred after an
amniocentesis at 24 and 3/7 weeks gestation.  She was treated
with betamethasone at that time.  The leak re-sealed and she
accumulated fluid.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple allergies.
2.  Migraine headaches.
3.  Status post breast reduction surgery.
4.  The mother also smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  (Including pertinent
laboratory data)  She was monitored closely.  She was also
known to have a chronic placental abruption.  For the three
days prior to delivery she was noted to have increased
bleeding, and she was taken to cesarean section.

The infant emerged with fair tone and spontaneous
respirations.  Apgar scores were 7 at one minute of age and 8
at five minutes of age.  He was admitted to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit for treatment of prematurity.

On physical examination upon admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit, weight was 1.63 kilograms, length was 43
cm, and head circumference was 27 cm.  In general, he was pale
and poorly perfused with slow capillary refill.  Skin was without
lesions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed fontanel open and flat.  Symmetric facial features.
The palate was intact.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Chest examination
revealed lungs were clear.  The abdomen was soft and
nontender.  No masses.  Genitourinary revealed normal
premature genitalia; right testicle not fully descended.
Spine was straight with intact sacrum.  Hips were stable.
Neurologic was nonfocal and age appropriate examination.

1.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  [**Known lastname 12225**] required treatment for mild
respiratory distress with continuous positive airway
pressure.  By day of life number one he had weaned to oxygen
by nasal cannula, and he was on room air by day of life
three.  He also required treatment for apnea of prematurity
with caffeine citrate.  The caffeine was discontinued on [**2164-6-21**], and his last episode of spontaneous apnea and
bradycardia occurred on [**2164-7-13**].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  Due to his poor perfusion at the
time of birth, [**Known lastname 12225**] required two normal saline boluses.  He
showed rapid improvement in his blood pressure and perfusion.
A soft intermittent murmur has been noted during admission.
Four-extremity blood pressures were within normal limits.
The murmur was thought to be consistent with peripheral
pulmonic stenosis.  The murmur was not noted at the time of
discharge.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  [**Known lastname 12225**] was
initially nothing by mouth and maintained on intravenous
fluids.  Enteral feeds were started on day of life one and
gradually advanced to full volume.  His mother had difficulty
breast feeding due to the breast reduction, so he both breast
fed and was fed expressed mother's milk.  His maximum caloric
intake was 28 calories per ounce.  At the time of discharge,
he was taking a minimum of 130 cc/kg per day of Enfamil 24
calories per ounce or expressed breast milk with 4 calories
added as Enfamil powder.

His weight on the day of discharge was 3.06 kilograms.
Electrolytes were checked within the first week of life and
within normal limits.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  Due to the respiratory
distress at the time of birth, [**Known lastname 12225**] was evaluated for
sepsis.  Blood culture obtained prior to starting intravenous
antibiotics was no growth at 48 hours, and the antibiotics
were discontinued.  There were no other infectious disease
issues during admission.

5.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Hematocrit at the time of birth was
40%.  A low hematocrit was noted on [**2164-7-3**] at 24.2%
with a reticulocyte count of 4.8%.  His elemental iron dose
was increased, and a repeat hematocrit on the day of
discharge was 29% with a reticulocyte count of 3.1%.  He was
to be discharged home on supplemental iron.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  [**Known lastname 12225**] required treatment for
hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.  His peak serum
bilirubin occurred on day of life seven with a total of 12.8
mg/dL over 0.5 mg/dL direct.  He received approximately three
days of phototherapy.  His rebound bilirubin on day of life
10 on [**2164-6-19**] was total bilirubin of 4.8 and direct
bilirubin 0.3.  Also of note, [**Known lastname 12225**] had an umbilical stump
granuloma that has been drying spontaneously and did not
require treatment.

7.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  [**Known lastname 12225**] has had two normal head
ultrasounds in the first week of life, and again a repeat at
one month of age.  There were no neurologic concerns at the

color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] 3. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posterior
directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A1, A2
severe prolapse is seen. No obvious chordal rupture or flail
noted. Mitral Annulus is not dilated. POST-BYPASS: For the
post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and is being A paced. 1. A
bioprosthesis is well seated in the Mitral position. Leaflets
open well. No MR is seen. Mean gradient across the valve is 5 mm
of Hg with a CO of 4.5 l/min. Although one of the mitral struts
appears to encroach the LVOT, peak gradient across the LVOT and
AV is less than 15 mm of Hg. 2. LV Anterior wall appears
slightly hypokinetic. RV function is preserved. 3. Aorta is
intact post decannulation. 4. IVC-RA junction appears intact, no
turbulence noted on CFD. (intrapericardial IVC repair done)

ADDENDUM:  There is one correction from initial discharge
summary under hospital course.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent thrombectomy with
directed TPA, which is tissue plasminogen activator not total
parenteral alimentation.

From an pulmonary standpoint the patient remained off the
ventilator and on a 40% tracheostomy mask for greater periods
of time throughout the day.  He was off the ventilator for a
total of 48 hours and on the trach mask at which time he then
fatigued and required resting on minimal amounts of pressure
support and at this time is able to tolerate tracheostomy
mask for over twelve hours per day.  He had a Passy Muir
valve placed and tolerates it well.  His cough has improved.
He is able to clear his own secretions requires less
suctioning.

From an infectious disease standpoint, the patient is to
complete his course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia on
[**2166-11-19**].  At this time he remains afebrile, although his
white count has been slowly rising, all remaining cultures
have been no growth to date and he will need to be monitored
after discharge for any evidence of persistent infection
after his antibiotics are completed.  Blood cultures were
sent on [**12-19**] from his right sided PICC line as well as C-diff
stool cultures sent on [**12-18**], which is pending at this time.

Hematology, the patient received one additional unit of
packed red blood cells on [**11-17**] for a hematocrit of 23.
There has been no evidence of active bleeding.  His stools
have been guaiac negative.  This was felt secondary to
frequent phlebotomy.  His hematocrit bumped to 28
appropriately and has remained stable.

Nutrition, the patient remained on tube feeds at his goal
rate of 60 cc per hour.  He is having normal bowel movements
and remains on Prevacid for a history of upper
gastrointestinal bleed, which is stable.

Cardiovascular, the patient was restarted on Lopresor as well
as Lipitor for his history of hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia.  He was not restarted on Amiodarone
given the potential lung toxicity.

Psychiatric, over the past several days the patient had
episodes of increased confusion and agitation.  His
benzodiazepines and opiates were discontinued and the patient
was started on Zyprexa, which will be increased to 5 mg po
q.h.s., which has improved his overall mental status.  On the
day of this dictation the patient is oriented to person and
time, but not to place, but he is less agitated and is
pleasant and cooperative.  On [**11-17**] he had an episode of
agitation where he removed his tracheostomy, which was
replaced without incident and he has been doing well since
that time.

Access, the patient has a right sided PICC line placed on
[**12-15**], tracheostomy placed [**12-9**] and changed on [**12-18**], PEG
placed on [**12-10**], Foley catheter and he will have a voiding
trial today remains in place at this time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 mg per G tube q day,
Lopressor 50 mg per G tube b.i.d., intravenous heparin,
regular insulin sliding scale b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg per G
tube q day, Zyprexa 5 mg po q.h.s., Atrovent nebulizers one

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath status
post left anterior descending stenting

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman, a
nursing home resident, with known coronary artery disease
status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of
the left anterior descending x 2 in [**2137**], non-Q myocardial
infarction in [**2145**], who complained of chest pain associated
with shortness of breath starting the night prior to
admission.  She was given sublingual nitroglycerin at the
nursing home.  She was then brought to the Emergency Room at
2 P.M. on the day of admission.  In the Emergency Room, her
temperature was 97.6, blood pressure 91/43, pulse 75,
respirations 21, and oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters. Her
examinations were notable for bilateral pedal edema,
bilateral crackles, and guaiac positive stools.  Her
electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular rate, incomplete left bundle branch block, ST
elevations in V1 to V2, ST depression in I, II, AVL, V5 to
V6, with T wave inversions in I, II, AVL and V3 through V6.
She remained stable in the Emergency Room, and her initial CK
was 91, troponin was less than .3, hematocrit was 33.4, and
INR was 2.9.

Because of the concern for acute myocardial infarction, she
was started on a nitro drip and was brought to the
catheterization laboratory directly.  Catheterization
revealed three vessel disease with left anterior descending
proximal 80%, left circumflex proximal 70%, obtuse marginal I
80%, obtuse marginal II 80%, and right coronary artery
proximal 60%, and mid 70% stenosis.  The proximal left
anterior descending was successfully stented.  The right
heart catheterization showed PA 63% with a calculated cardiac
index of 2.34, RA pressure mean of 14, RV pressure 49/11,
with an end diastolic pressure of 16, PA pressure 56/26, with
a mean of 39, wedge of 25.

Because of her initial INR of 2.9, she had excessive bleeding
at the right femoral site, with Angioseal
post-catheterization.  The bleeding was controlled with
pressure for two hours.  Due to excessive bleeding, no
Integrilin was given post-catheterization, and two units of
fresh frozen plasma were ordered.  She was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for overnight observation.

Date of Birth:   [**2130-1-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Neonatology
HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 46526**] is a 2215 gram 33-1/7 gestation
male newborn is admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit
for management of prematurity.

Infant was born to a 26-year-old G1 P0 mother.  Serologies:
surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive.  GBS unknown.
Pregnancy was notable for an abnormal alpha fetoprotein with
normal amniocentesis.  Preterm labor was onset of
contractions the day prior to admission when evaluated on the
day of delivery, mother was found to be 3-4 cm dilated and
maternal white count of 22.7 was concerned for possible
chorioamnionitis.
On the day of delivery, mother received one dose of
betamethasone, proceeded to a vaginal delivery.  The NICU
team was present at the delivery.  The infant emerged with
some activity, tone, and weak cry.  Was bulb suctioned,
dried, stimulated, and provided with blow-by O2.  Did show
some improvement, but infant with poor aeration and
retraction.  Facial CPAP applied with improvement.  Apgars
six at one minute and seven at five minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Birth weight 2215, greater than
75th percentile, length 48 cm, 90th percentile, head
circumference 31 cm, 50th percentile.  The discharge weight
of 2235 grams.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Pale-pink infant with retraction and
decreased tone and cranial molding.  Anterior fontanels soft
and flat.  Regular, rate, and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at
the left lower sternal border.  Palate and clavicles intact.
Abdomen is soft, minimal bowel sounds, normal male phallus.
Testes down bilaterally.  Patent anus, no sacral anomalies.
Stable hips.  Extremities pale with three second perfusion.
Three vessel cord, and tone responsiveness decreased.

REVIEW OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Respiratory:  Baby required intubation and received three
doses of Surfactant, weaned on vent settings, and was
extubated on day of life two.  While intubated, had a gas of
7.37/42/47/25. The baby transitioned [**Name2 (NI) 38702**] to room
air on day of life two.  Did require nasal cannula O2 briefly
on day of life five, and is currently in room air with no
respiratory distress.  Baseline heart rate of 40s-60s.
Initial chest x-ray was consistent with hilar membrane
disease.  Baby has not exhibited any apnea or bradycardia of
prematurity.

Cardiovascular:  On admission, the baby had a marginally low
blood pressure with means in the 30s, and received three
normal saline boluses.  He did not require pressure support.
Murmur was resolved by day of life three, and has had no
further cardiovascular issues.  Baseline heart rate is
130s-150s with blood pressure systolics in the 60s,
diastolics in the 40s, and means in the 40s-50s.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Baby initially had a
peripheral IV, and was started on maintenance IV fluids.  As
his respiratory status stabilized, enteral feedings were
introduced on day of life two.  He advanced to full enteral
feeding without issue.  Is currently feeding breast milk 24
calories/ounce achieved by adding 4 calories/ounce of human
milk fortifier at 150 cc/kg/day, and he is taking an
occasional bottle, but is primarily PG feeding.  Initial
electrolytes at 24 hours:  Sodium 136, potassium 5.8,
chloride 104, CO2 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.4.  D sticks were
always stable greater than 50, and baby is learning to po
feed.  Mom is pumping and has had assistance with lactation
consultant.

Gastrointestinal:  Baby's blood type is O positive, is
Coomb's negative, demonstrated some physiologic jaundice with
a peak bilirubin on day of life five of 12.1/0.3.  Was on
single phototherapy.  Phototherapy was discontinued on day of
life seven, and his rebound bilirubin on day of life eight
was 8/0.37/.7.  He has had no further issues.

Hematology:  Blood type as stated above.  Baby did not
receive any blood products during this admission.  Hematocrit
on admission was 51.7.

Infectious Disease:  Because of the concern of chorioamnionitis
and respiratory distress, the baby had a blood culture and a
complete blood count drawn at the time of delivery.  White
count was 7.6, 27 polys, 0 bands, 61 lymphocytes with
platelet count of 274,000, hematocrit of 51.7.  Baby was
started on ampicillin and gentamicin.  At 48 hours, the
cultures remained negative.  Baby was improving clinically,
the antibiotics were discontinued.  He has had no further
issues regarding infection.

Neurology:  Baby is appropriate for gestational age.  Because
of gestational age of greater than 32 weeks, head ultrasound
is not indicated.

Sensory:  Audiology screening has not been performed at the
time of transfer.

Ophthalmology:  Eye examination not indicated.  Baby greater
than 32 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB: Pt seen by GI who did not want to emergently scope pt
since he was having an NSTEMI. He recieved 1 unit PRBCS in the
ED and another 2 overnight within 12 hrs of his arrival to the
unit. His vitals signs remained stable and Hct bumped
appropriately to the mid 30's after the two units (29.8 -->
34.5). He arrived with a femoral cordis, which later was
displaced, so two periperhal IVs were started. Protonix IV. Q6h
hcts were done, and then decreased to q8 and then q12.
He was called out on the morning of his first hopsital day since
he was stable and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on HD #2.
The pt had no further episodes of melena in the hospital and was
entirely asymptomatic. Diet was adv as tolerated, and plan was
for outpt EGD and colonoscopy in 2-3wks. Plavix and beta-blocker
were held in hospital. Transfusion goal was hct>30; pt did not
require further transfusion. After discussion with GI, pt was
discharged on aspirin and on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI (new) prior to the
procedure. Pt was instructed to hold plavix at home until the
colonoscopy.
.
2. NSTEMI: In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG showed ST segment depressions and
TWI in the lateral leads which were different from prior EKG.
His troponin was 0.16 in the ED but increased 8 hours later,
along with a rise in his CK and MB. These continued to climb
over the next 24 hours, but plateued by the second hospital day.
Serial EKG's were checked which showed no new change. Cardiology
consult obtained in the ED; decision was to defer intervention
as this was likely demand ischemia, hold plavix since he had
been 1 yr out form his stnet placement. Pt placed on tele with
no events and he never had chest pain or other anginal symptoms.

On the floor, pt had several brief episodes of asymptomatic
bradycardia to 30's with increased ectopy. An EKG showed no
changes.
Echo showed: EF > 60%. No AS, no AR. Mild PA HTN. Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
.
3. ESRD: Renal consult obtained in ED did not find a need for
emergent HD. Pt had HD on ICU day 1. Pt's home HD is Tu/Th/Sat.
.
4. DM: On home regimen with good control.
.
5. Hyperchol. Increased lipitor to 40qd.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] is a 53 yo male patient who began feeling poorly 2
weeks prior to admission with fevers, neck pain, myalgias, and
arthralgias.  Laboratory work at his primary care provider's
office revealed a thrombocytopenia for which he was referred to
the oncology clinic.  Upon eval at oncology clinic, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**]
was confused and lethargic for 1-2 days and he was sent to an
OSH ED for evaluation.  Blood cultures at this OSH grew GPC for
which he was initially treated with vancomycin and clindamicin.
He later grew Group B Strep and his antibiotics were changed to
gentamicin and pencillin.  A tran-thoracic echocardigram
revealed a 1.5 cm vegetation on his aortic valve and at this

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2146-1-30**].
He was initially evaluated by cardiology and neurology.  Head CT
and MRI rose question of epidural abscess and neuro-surgery was
consulted.  An infectious disease consult was also initiated
immediately with recommendation for ongoing gent and Pen G.
A C3-C6 epidural abscess was suspected with associated
meningitis and sepsis and he was taken emergently to the OR for
C3-C6 laminectomy on [**2146-1-31**].  Addional findings of ""weak bone""
associated with osteo but no findings of focal abscess.
The cardiac surgery team was consulted on [**2146-2-2**].  TEE on [**2146-2-2**]
supported diagnosis or endocarditis.  Over the next several
days, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] went through a pre-operative evaluation and was
followed by neurology, neuro surgery, and infectious disease.
He continued to be in the ICU, intubated, and confused/agitated.
 It was felt that he was not ready for surgery and that the
longer antibiotics could be continued prior to surgery the
better Mr. [**Known lastname 58889**] outcomes would be.  He was also treated for
pneumonia.
He was successfully extubated on [**2146-2-7**] and remianed extubated
through [**2-11**] however he remained in the ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.
Ongoing CHF with inability to obtain optimal hemodynamics pushed
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] to surgery emergently on [**2-14**].
On [**2146-2-14**] he proceeded to the OR with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm perimount
pericardial valve.  Please see OR report for full details.
On POD 1, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] failed to [**Doctor Last Name **] from the ventilator.
Infectious disease continued to follow Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] with ongoing
recs for vancomycin and levofloxacin.
On POD 2 he was succcessfully weened and extubated.  ID
discontinued his fluconazole.  He continued with an altered
mental status.
POD 3 through 7 he continued with hemodynamic monitoring and abx
administration.  He continued to be confused in the ICU.
A neuro consult on POD 7 stated significantly improved mental
status.  He was continued on haldol but began to [**Doctor Last Name **] from it.
On POD 9 he was transferred to the inpatinet floor for ongoing
recovery and rehabilitation.  His haldol was weened over the
next three days with ongoing dosing only at bedtime with
significant clearing of mental status to.  Neuro surgery was
again consulted to eval need for ongoing use of cervical collar
that Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] had been wearing since his laminectomy and it
was decided that he did not need to continue wearing it.
On POD 10 he was noted to have a worsening heart murmur and TTE
was obtained showing a ventricular septal defect.  Further
evaluation of this VSD (as a TEE) was declined as no surgical
intervention was felt to be necessary.
He continued with physical therapy through POD 15 and it was
felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] would benefit greatly from rehabilitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
mucinous adenocarcinoma arising from appendix with extensive
carcinomatosis and tumor involving the small bowel near the
SMA diagnosed by exploratory laparotomy in [**2100-5-6**].  He
underwent a palliative bypass procedure at that time.  He was
readmitted on [**7-27**] with a 2-week history of increasing
abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and a temperature of 104.8
degrees with peritoneal signs on abdominal examination.  CT
scan revealed worsening of small bowel distention, small
bowel wall thickening, increased ascites, and extra luminous
air, and a small collection in the right lower quadrant.
This collection did not appear amenable to drainage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, on [**2101-7-28**], in the early a.m.
the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and a small
bowel resection.  Preoperative diagnosis was perforated
viscous.  Postoperative diagnosis was small bowel
perforation.  The surgeon of record was Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1305**].
Findings intraoperatively included a closed-loop obstruction,
bypass small bowel with perforation in the right upper
quadrant.  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit for postoperative care.  He was intubated as of
postoperative day one.  Due to the perforated viscous, the
patient was kept on Kefzol and Flagyl antibiotics
postoperatively.  The patient was extubated on [**7-29**].  He
did remain n.p.o. with nasogastric tube suction at this time
and remained on Kefzol and Flagyl.  He required transfusion
of 1 unit of packed red blood cells on [**7-30**] for a
hematocrit of 27.8.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**7-31**].  His
nasogastric tube was discontinued.  The patient was to be
transferred to the floor, but he still had some hypotension
issues and was actually kept until [**8-1**].  Enalapril and
Lopressor were able to keep his blood pressure under control,
and he was transferred to the floor on [**8-1**].

On [**8-2**], the patient continued to do well, and his
Kefzol and Flagyl were discontinued.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on [**8-3**].  The patient was tolerating clears
as of [**8-3**].  On [**8-4**], on the patient's abdominal
examination, there was noted to be an increase in
serosanguineous drainage from the site of the incision, and
the patient had a temperature of 101.2 degrees.  A CT scan on
[**8-4**] revealed a right-sided intra-abdominal fluid
collection.  This collection was drained by Interventional
Radiology on [**8-5**] with a #12 French pigtail placed in
the right lower quadrant; 70 cc of purulent material were
drained at this time.  At the time of discharge, the culture
from this fluid had grown out no anaerobes, no enterococcus,
two colonies of gram-negative rods in moderate quantity.  A
third gram-negative rod species, sparse, gram-positive
bacteria, also streptococcus and gram-positive rods in broth
only.

The patient did very well after this drain was put in.  The
patient was also put on levofloxacin and Flagyl as of
[**8-5**].  The patient was advanced to a regular diet as of
[**2101-8-7**].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  As of [**2101-8-9**], the patient
was stable for discharge to home with [**Hospital6 1587**] care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  He was to be discharged on
Avandia 4 mg p.o. q.d., levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d.,
Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**].  The
patient will also receive [**Hospital6 407**] for
drain care at home, and also b.i.d. dry sterile dressing
changes to his wound.

Prothrombin time 13.2, PTT 26.8, INR 1.2.  Urinalysis was
clear.  No evidence of infection.

Chest x-ray showed a minimal opacity in her left lower lobe,
no evidence of congestive heart failure.

Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm at 98 beats per
minute, left anterior descending, normal intervals, ST
elevation in 1 mm in V1 through V6 and Lead 3 and AVF.
Q-waves in V2 through V6 with loss of R-waves compared to
[**2125-8-22**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious Disease.  Initial blood cultures [**2125-8-30**] grew
gram positive cocci in clusters 4/4 bottles.  She was
continued on Vancomycin until Oxacillin sensitivities were
acquired.  She continued to spike fevers through [**2125-8-31**],
Gentamicin was started for synergy. Infectious Disease was
consulted to evaluate the patient, they recommended serial blood
cultures as well as right upper extremity ultrasound.  Ultrasound
revealed a right cephalic vein with thrombophlebitis, no evidence
of an abscess or fluid collection.  Repeat blood cultures were
negative.  She was also evaluated with a transesophageal
echocardiogram for endocarditis.  She was discharged with a PICC
line to rehabilitation in order to receive outpatient Oxacillin
for a total of 4 weeks after the last negative blood culture.

2.  Cardiac.  On [**2125-8-30**] she presented to the emergency
department with Electrocardiogram changes as noted and a
Troponin of 7.5 consistent with myocardial infarction.
Serial cardiac enzymes trended downward.  An echocardiogram
was done which revealed focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall of the right ventricle as well as a mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, left hypokinesis of the
distal septum, inferior and apical walls.  Her ejection
fraction was noted to be 40%  Heparin was not started due to
her recent intracranial surgery however, she was placed on a
beta-blocker, Ace inhibitor and aspirin.

After three weeks from her postoperative date the plan is to
consider anti-coagulation given the upper extremity clot.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient has a history of asthma, treated
with Theophylline and Albuterol.  She also has a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV 1/FVC ratio
of 63%  She will continue her Theophylline and Albuterol and
start an Atrovent inhaler.

4.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrients:  On admission she had
a decrease K of 2.1, as well as decreased magnesium and
phosphate.  Her electrolytes were repleted.  She will need
her electrolytes followed as an outpatient as she will be
continued on Lasix and Theophylline.

5.  Vascular/Heme:  While in house she was evaluated by the
Vascular Surgery team and they did not feel surgical removal
of the septic thrombus would be necessary. They recommended
treatment with warm compresses to her right arm and elevation
of the arm.  She was also worked up for normocytic anemia and
iron studies are pending at the time of discharge. According to
vascular surgery the cephalic vein clot is not proximal enough to
require anticoagulation although this could still be considered.
She should have a upper extrmity ultrasound in [**2-26**] weeks to
evaluate for progression of the clot.

GI bleeding study:
IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of active GI bleeding.  A
faint area of
increased radiotracer uptake on the lateral view after one hour
was seen within the rectum, but was less intense on the lateral
view one half-hour later.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female with pseudogout and dementia pw h/o BRBPR after
recent course of steroids and NSAIDs for a pseudogout flare.
.
1. BRBPR: BRBPR x days to weeks. Likely related to recent course
of steroids and NSAIDs for a pseudogout flare (5 days of
steroids and 7 days of naproxen). HD stable, Hct stable on
admission. LGIB more likely than UGIB given history and HD
stability. It is likely that she developed a mild bleed
secondary to recent steroids/NSAIDs causing ulcerations. Hct was
trended frequently. There was frank blood on the bed sheets on
the day of admission. Her Hct dropped from 33 to 26 on that day.
She was on a PPI IV BID. Pt was kept NPO for possible studies
and transferred to the MICU and GI was consulted. Given that pt
remained HD stable, it was believed that it was in part at least
due to dilution. A tagged RBC scan was performed and was
essentially unrevealing with some question of increased uptake
in the rectal area. She had no further bloody stools during her
hospitalization received 4units blood total in transfusion over
the course of her stay.
.
The GI team discussed the option of doing a colonoscopy to look
for a source of GI bleeding. However, the patient's sister, who
is her health care proxy, preferred that she not have a
colonoscopy unless it was absolutely medically necessary. The GI
service felt that the patient would benefit from a colonoscopy
as an outpatient, but that she is hemodynamically stable at the
current time. A further discussion of the benefit of colonoscopy
could be had with the patient's primary care physician who is
more familiar with her and her family's long term goals of care.
Her hematocrit on discharge was 26.2.
.
2. Anemia: Hct stable at baseline on admission (baseline of
32-35). Recent workup during admission in [**11-21**] revealed anemia
of chronic disease based on iron studies. Further workup
included: TSH wnl, SPEP neg, UPEP negative. However, Hct was
trended on day of admission and dropped (see above), likely
unrelated to her baseline anemia. She was discharged on iron
therapy.
.
3. Dementia: Progressive Alzheimer's disease. Recent w/u for
other causes included the following labs: RPR nonreactive, LFTs
and lytes normal, and TSH normal. Pt frequently wanders around
and required sitter during previous admissions. She was kept
briefly with 1:1 sitter as well. Pt was continued zyprexa and
aricept for medical management.
.
4. Pseudogout: Recently diagnosed during last admission in
[**11-21**]. Currently no c/o joint pain. Recent flare resolved with 5
days of steroids and 7 days of naproxen. Patient on long term on
tylenol for pain relief given underlying osteoarthritis. If
pseudogout would recur again, it was recommended during last
admission to start colchicine for prophylaxis after another
course of naprosyn with close monitoring of creatinine. However,
given GIB, no NSAIDs or steroids should be given at this point.
.
5. FEN: IVF, repleted electrolytes as needed.
.
6. PPx: Heparin sc, PPI IV BID, sitter.
.
7. Code status: Full.
.
8. Contact: Sister [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106957**]. HCP is sister [**Name (NI) **]

[**2200-8-21**] - XRAY
Minimally displaced right proximal humerus fracture through the
greater tuberosity.

[**2200-8-25**] - Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
did not
reveal any flow limiting coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD,
LCx,
and RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurement revealed mildly elevated left
and
right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 15 mm Hg and an
RVEDP of
12 mm Hg. The mean PCWP was moderately elevated at 25 mm Hg. The
mean
PASP was mildly elevated at 30 mm Hg. There was severe aortic
valve
stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 64 mm Hg and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of
0.44
cm2. The Fick cardiac index was preserved at 2.51 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography did not demonstrate any wall motion
abnormalities. The LVEF was calculated at 63%.

[**2200-8-29**] ECHO
Prebypass:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+)aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The vena contracta measures 0.6cm.

Postbypass:

There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. There is
no aortic
insufficiency or perivalvular leak seen. Peak gradient is 7mmHg
with a mean gradient of 4mmHg. Preserved bioventricular
function. Aortic contours are intact. All findings were
discussed with [**Month/Day (2) 5059**] at time of exam.



Brief Hospital Course:

it says in the text of the dictation:  ""However by
postoperative day number six the patient's sternum continued
to drain a substantial amount of serosanguinous fluid and
plastic surgery continued to examine the patient and closely
monitor the necessity of incising the obvious area of
infection.""  This is an incorrect statement.  The patient had
no infection.  All cultures that have been finally reviewed
and obtained on this patient from the wound have revealed no
bacterial growth.  Diagnosis on this patient was a sterile
sternal wound dehiscence necessitating operative
intervention.

2 woman.  Her prenatal screens are blood type A positive,
antibody negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis
surface antigen negative and group B strep unknown.  This
twenty years and elevated blood pressures during the
pregnancy prompting a repeat cesarean section.

The infant emerged vigorous.  Apgars were 8 at one minute and
9 at minutes.  There was rupture of membranes at the time of
delivery.  No intrapartum fever and no other sepsis risk
factors.  The infant's birth weight was 1175 grams, birth

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Premature nondysmorphic
infant large for gestational age.  His anterior fontanel open
and flat.  Positive bilateral red reflex.  Intact palette.

murmur at the left sternal border, femoral pulses +2, three
vessel umbilical cord, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Testes
descended bilaterally.  Patent anus.  Normal sacrum.  Stable
hip examination and symmetric tone and reflexes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory status:  The infant was
intubated for respiratory distress soon after admission to
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.  He received one dose of
Surfactant and extubated to room air on day of life number
one where he has remained.  He had one episode of apnea,
bradycardia, and desaturation on day of life number four. He was
monitored for five days subsequent to this without further
episodes.

2.  Cardiovascular status:  He required a normal saline bolus
for blood pressure support on admission.  The initial murmur
resolved.  He has had a grade [**1-2**] soft intermittent murmur
without any hemodynamic consequences.  He has remained
normotensive since day of life number one.

3.  Fluid, electrolyte and nutrition status:  Enteral feeds
were begun on day of life number one and advanced without

Admission Date: [**2114-6-18**]
Discharge Date: [**2114-7-5**]
Date of Birth:  [**2114-6-18**]
Sex:  F
Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 1661**] was born at 32
and 1/7 weeks gestation and admitted to the NICU with
prematurity and respiratory distress. She was born at 10:42
a.m. on [**2114-6-18**] weighing 1775 grams, the product of a 32
and [**1-28**] week twin gestation pregnancy to a 37 year-old, G3,
P2 now 4 mother with an estimated date of confinement of
[**2114-8-12**].  Prenatal labs included blood type B positive,
antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, HBSAG
negative, GBS unknown.  This pregnancy was notable for
mono/mono twin gestation, reportedly spontaneous, complicated
by early cord entanglement, prompting admission at 25 weeks
gestation. Mother was treated with betamethasone at that time
and had remained hospitalized with intensive monitoring. Some
signs of fetal distress have been noted over the past several
days although ultrasound had been reassuring. The patient
reached 32 weeks gestation and decision was made to proceed
with Cesarean delivery at that time, due to the increased
risks of complications. Mother had experienced occasional
preterm contractions but was not in labor. The membranes were
intact at delivery and the mother did not receive intrapartum
antibiotic prophylaxis. The maternal history was otherwise
non contributory and the family is intact.

At delivery, this infant emerged with good tone, cry and
required stimulation and blow-by oxygen only. Occasional
apnea was noted in the delivery room which required positive
pressure ventilation. The infant was brought to the NICU for
further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
showed a birth weight of 1775 grams which is 50th percentile.
Head circumference of 30.5 cm which is 50th to 75th
percentile.  Length of 42 cm which is 25 to 50th percentile.
The infant was warm and dry, premature infant in mild to
moderate distress at rest.  Active with examination and
mildly reduced spontaneous activity. HEENT showed fontanel
soft and flat.  Nares normal. Intact palate.  Neck:  Supple,
no lesions.  Chest:  Coarse breath sounds, mildly aerated,
mild to moderate retractions, mild grunting. Work of
breathing less with CPAP.  Cardiac:  Normal rate and rhythm,
no murmur.  Abdomen soft, no hepatosplenomegaly, no mass, 3
vessel cord, quiet bowel sounds.  Genitourinary:  Normal
female, patent anus.  Femoral pulses 2+.  Extremities, hips,
back normal.  Neuro:  Appropriate tone, mildly reduced
activity. Moves all extremities well.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: The infant was started on CPAP
on admission to the NICU and remained on CPAP until [**2114-6-21**]
when the infant then successfully transitioned to nasal
cannula oxygen. She subsequently transitioned to room air by
[**2114-6-22**] and has remained on room air since that time. She
was started on caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity on
[**2114-6-20**] and remains on caffeine citrate at this time. She
continues to have occasional apnea and bradycardiac episodes,
anywhere from 1 to 5 per day, typically mild self-resolved
spells.  Breath sounds are clear and equal and mild to slight
retractions are noted.

Cardiovascular:  The infant received a single normal saline
bolus for perfusion on admission to the NICU.  A murmur
presented on day of life and subsequently resolved.  The
murmur reappeared on [**2114-6-22**].  A duct check was done.
Echocardiogram duct check was done at that time which showed
a moderate sized PDA 2 mm in size. The murmur subsequently
resolved within a couple of days, due to the fact that the
infant was stable on room air at the time of the murmur.  No
indomethacin was given. The murmur has subsequently resolved
and a repeat duct check was done on [**2114-6-25**] which showed no
PDA at that time. She has remained cardiovascularly stable
with normal heart rates and blood pressures throughout.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: The infant was made
n.p.o. on admission to the NICU due to the mild respiratory
distress. Peripheral IV was placed and IV fluids were
initiated at that time. Enteral feedings were initiated on
[**2114-6-20**] which was day of life 2. They were subsequently
advanced.  She was made n.p.o. when her murmur presented on
[**2114-6-22**] due to concern for a PDA. She remained n.p.o. for 3
days at that time, at which time a follow-up duct check had
shown there was no PDA and enteral feedings were reinitiated
at that time. At the time when the murmur presented, she did
have a small bilious emesis. Those had resolved prior to
reinitiation of feeds, when her feedings were then
reinitiated on [**2114-6-25**]. They were further advanced to full
volume feedings. She achieved full volume feedings by
[**2114-6-30**]. She has had intermittent large emesis requiring
decrease in total fluids to 140 ml per kg per day. She is
presently on 140 ml/kg/day of 22 calorie breast milk or [**Doctor Last Name **]
Special Care. She does receive that over 1-1/2 hours to 2
hours to decrease spits. Her most recent weight is  1835 grams.

Her most recent set of electrolytes were done on [**2114-6-28**].
Sodium 137; potassium of 4.6; chloride 103; C02 of 23. She is
not on any electrolyte supplementation.

Gastrointestinal:  The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia
and had a peak bilirubin level of 8.8 over 0.3. She received
a total of 5 days of phototherapy. Her most recent bilirubin
level was 7.0 over 0.3 on [**2114-6-29**]. She had a repeat
bilirubin done on [**2114-7-2**]. The result is  7.4/0.4.

Hematology:  A hematocrit at birth was 41.2 with a platelet
count of 207. There have been no further hematocrits or
platelets measured. The infant has not had any blood typing
done.

Infectious disease:  CBC and blood culture were screened on
admission to the NICU, due to the respiratory distress and
prematurity.  The CBC was benign with no left shift. The
infant was initiated on ampicillin and gentamycin which were
subsequently discontinued at 48 hours of age when the blood
cultures remained negative at that time. There had been no
further issues with sepsis.

Neurology:  The infant has maintained a normal neurologic
exam for gestational age. A single head ultrasound was done
on [**2114-6-26**] and found to be within normal limits with no
intraventricular hemorrhage.

Audiology:  A hearing screen  has not been performed but will
need to be done prior to discharge to home.

Psychosocial:  A [**Hospital1 69**] social
worker has been in contact with the family. There are no
active issues but, if there are any concerns, she can be
reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  stable

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Transfer to level II nursery at

CARDIAC ASSESSMENT:  PG feeds with transition to p.o.
feedings, to initiate soon, at 140 ml per kg per day of
breast milk 26 or Special Care 26 with beneprotein, gavage fed
over 90 min for spits.
Medications:

Iron and vitamin D supplementation.
1.  Iron supplementation is recommended for preterm and low
    birth weight infants until 12 months corrected age.
2.  All infants fed predominantly breast milk should receive
    Vitamin D supplementation at 200 i.u. (may be provided as
    a multi-vitamin preparation) daily until 12 months
    corrected age.
3.  Car seat position screening will need to be done prior to
    discharge to home.
4.  State newborn screen was sent on day of life 3.  Results
    are pending.

IMMUNIZATIONS:  The infant has not received any immunizations
thus far.
Immunizations recommended:
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **]
through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four
criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between
32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38472**] is a 58 year old
male transferred to the Medical Service from the Neurosurgery
Service on [**2170-12-31**].  The patient was initially
admitted on [**12-26**], for elective laminectomy which was
uncomplicated except for a 2.5 units estimated blood loss and
administration of two units of packed red blood cells and 9
liters of Crystalloid in the Operating Room.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be hypoxic and
hypotensive requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure
support, and then nine hours postoperatively, CT scan
angiogram found to have large flow obstructing right
pulmonary artery embolus and a smaller left lower lobe and
lingular emboli.  The patient's pulmonary emboli was lysed
with tissue plasminogen activator and removed by suction
thrombectomy with good affect.

Echocardiogram following the procedure showed some mild right
ventricular dilatation and free wall hypokinesis and a normal
left ventricle.  An inferior vena cava filter was also
placed.  He was intubated for approximately 48 hours with
successful intubation and normal low O2 requirements since
then.  He was heparinized postoperatively, requiring
inordinately high doses of heparin up to 2500 units per hour
to maintain therapeutic PTT in the 60 to 80 range.  Coumadin
was started on [**2170-12-31**], and he was transferred from
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine Floor.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Heparin drip.
2.  Zantac 75 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
4.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. per day.
5.  Oxy-Contin 20 mg p.o. three times a day.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. six hours p.r.n.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Senna, one to two tablets p.o. q. h.s. p.r.n.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cervical spondylosis, worse at the C4, C5 and C5-C6
levels with T1-T2 disc herniation.
2.  Preoperative cardiac work-up was negative.
3.  Peripheral neuropathy.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Depression.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Zoloft.
3.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Occasional ethanol.  No tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer, his vital signs were
temperature 98.4 F.; blood pressure 114/52; heart rate 79;
respiratory rate 27, saturating 96% on two liters.  He was
alert and oriented times three, pleasant, cooperative, neck
collar in place.  Oropharynx clear with moist mucous
membranes.  Neck with large cervical collar with large
posterior dressing; no jugular venous distention.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Heart was beating with a
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  He had
mild left upper extremity swelling with good pulses.  Lower
extremities sans edema.

LABORATORY:  His laboratories upon transfer were
unremarkable.  Hematocrit of 28.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In general, this is a 58 year old man,
status post laminectomy complicated by pulmonary embolism.
He was continued on heparin and Coumadin from [**12-31**]
until [**1-2**], when his INR reached 2.5 and heparin was
discontinued.  The patient will need to remain on life-long
Coumadin because of the presence of his [**Location (un) 260**] filter.

For his spinal surgery, he was followed by the Orthopedic
Service and continued in a C-collar.  He was evaluated by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and was deemed to
need acute rehabilitation upon discharge.

Pain control was with Oxy-Contin to be titrated over the two
weeks following discharge with Percocet p.r.n.  He was also
started on Topamax 50 mg twice a day for peripheral
neuropathy.  The patient's white count and laboratory
remained stable during the hospitalization and he was
transferred to rehabilitation hospital on [**1-3**], in
good condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Full.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. per day.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets q. four to six hours p.r.n.
3.  Topamax 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Senna one to two tablets p.o. q. h.s. p.r.n.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Oxy-Contin 20 mg p.o. three times a day.
7.  Zantac 75 mg p.o. twice a day.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o gentleman with CAD, AI, and CHF who is now
with recurrent episodes of pulseless cardiac arrest and
respiratory arrest (intubated).  Mild hypothermia protocol was
initiated, and patient was transferred to the MICU for further
management.

Upon arrival to MICU, patient exhibited progressive decline in
systolic blood pressure to <70 mmHg, despite maximum doses of
Phenylephrine, Epinephrine, and Norepinephrine and repeated iv
fluid boluses, and exhibited persistent acidemia, lactic
acidosis.

Following extensive discussion with family members (including
daughter/HCP [**Name (NI) 4317**] [**Name (NI) 931**]) regarding overall poor prognosis
and unlikelihood of recovery due to repeated episodes of
pulseless cardiac arrest requiring CPR and profound hypotension
despite extensive vasopressor support, no further interventions
were pursued, no further CPR, and focus of care transitioned to
comfort.  The patient expired quietly and peacefully with family
and chaplain at the bedside.

[**2160-12-29**] ECHO
PreBypass: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild global right ventricular hypokinesis. LV
apical hypokinesis is noted- the remaining left ventricular
segments contract normally.The ascending thoracic aorta is
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric
and anteriorly directed.. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Global RV and LV apical function improved. MVR
investigated - no MR noted, appropriate valve seating with
struts in good postion. Peak valve gradient 12. Descending and
ascending aorta without defect or flap dissection, aortic valve
without AI.

[**2161-1-2**] CXR
PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright
position demonstrate status post sternotomy and the presence of
multiple surgical clips in the anterior mediastinum consistent
with previous bypass surgery. In addition 3 small ring-shaped
metallic structures indicate the presence of a mitral valve
prosthesis in appropriate position. Comparison is made with the
previous chest examination of [**2160-12-31**] at that time
described persistent elevation of the right-sided hemidiaphragm
and evidence of pleural thickening mostly on the right side
remains rather unchanged. When comparison is made with the
preoperative chest examination dated [**2160-12-24**], i.e.
prior to mitral valve replacement evidence of sternotomy and
bypass surgery existed already. The now persisting elevation of
the diaphragmatic contour and adhesions surrounding the right
lower lobe area are new. Further follow up is recommended.


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor from [**Hospital3 10494**]. He was seen in consultation by dental medicine and was
cleared for surgery. He was started on heparin for his atrial
fibrillation. He underwent PFTs. He was taken to the operating
room  on [**2160-12-29**] where he underwent an MVR with a 27 mm
[**Company **] mosaic tissue valve via a right thoracotomy.
Postoperatively he was taken to the SICU in stable condition. He
awoke and was extubated later that same day. He was weaned from
his vasoactive drips and transferred to the floor on POD #1. He
did well post operatively. On POD #2, he was found to have a
prolonged PR interval to .4, for which he was seen by
electrophysiology. His beta blocker was subsequently
discontinued. He developed atrial fibrillation and flutter and
coumadin was subsequently started. His electrolytes were
repleted and he converted back to normal sinus rhythm.The
physical therapy service worked with him daily to increase his
postoperative strength and mobility. He was gently diuresed

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post
left pneumonectomy for lung carcinoma with likely primary
lung carcinoma on right asthma, chronic bronchitis, coronary
artery disease, atrial fibrillation and GI bleed.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital3 27946**] Hospital on [**2160-4-27**] for
recurrent right pneumonia.  His course at the outside
hospital was complicated by upper GI bleed, status post BICAP
cautery to ulcerated gastric polyp.  He had a visible vessel
and ruling in for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes,
CK 260, MB 9.1, troponin 0.96.  He had a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction on presentation to [**Hospital3 27946**]
Hospital with peak troponin of 3.46 on [**4-29**], CK of 306 in
the setting of his GI bleed.  The patient's hematocrit
dropped to 27.6 and he was transfused with two units of
packed red blood cells.  There was a right middle lobe
infiltrate noted on chest x-ray of [**4-29**] and on [**4-30**] it was
no longer seen.  On [**2160-5-6**] the patient had his PICC line
placed.  On [**2160-5-6**] the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for question of cardiac
catheterization as the patient described intermittent chest
pain and tightness described at 4/10, worsening over the last
five months, no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, but he has had
chest pain for the two days prior to admission here and
increased difficulty lying flat.  The patient also needed to
be intubated for two days at the outside hospital.  The
patient was weaned and extubated successfully.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Lung carcinoma status post left
pneumonectomy with possible right upper lobe primary lung
carcinoma.  2. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
he is steroid and O2 dependent.  3. Gastroesophageal reflux
disease.  4. Coronary artery disease.  5. Atrial
fibrillation, 4+ MR with mitral valve prolapse and an
ejection fraction of 50%.  6. Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1. Prednisone 10 once a day.  2.
Amiodarone 200 once a day.  3. Toprol XL 25 once a day.  4.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q. 4.  6. Alphagan for his
eyes.  5. Protonix 40 once a day.  6. Calcium carbonate 600
once a day.  7. Foradil one puff b.i.d.  8. Vitamin E.  9.
Xalatan drops.

ALLERGIES:  Cipro leads to hallucinations.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote tobacco, no alcohol, lives at home
with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were afebrile, 99/44, 97,
30, 98% on two liters.  He was well appearing in no apparent
distress, lying in bed at 60 degrees.  Sclerae were
anicteric, moist mucous membranes.  Pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, without
jugular venous distension.  Chest had positive wheezes
bilaterally, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, [**4-10**]
holosystolic murmur, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended without edema.  Cranial nerves two through 12
were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 31.7, hematocrit 32.1,
platelet count 178, 140/3.8, 98/38, 24/1.2, 129.  Arterial
blood gases 7.53, 46.5, 95 on two liters nasal cannula.
Albumin 2.2, digoxin 1.7, CK 260, MB 9.1, troponin 0.96.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 80-year-old male with severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status
post left pneumonectomy, transferred from an outside hospital
for further evaluation of coronary artery disease, ruling in
for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  The patient
originally was admitted to the medical intensive care unit
where he was observed overnight.

1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  The patient
was given Solu-Medrol 80 mg IV b.i.d. and given p.r.n.
nebulizers with DuoNebs q. 4 hours.  The patient was able to
tolerate that course.  As the patient's breathing became
better he was switched to oral prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.d. and
then started a taper.  The taper will end with his home dose
of prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient was not started on
antibiotics as the patient had antibiotics at outside
hospital.  The patient was continued on two liters nasal
cannula at all times.

2. Lung mass:  The patient likely has lung carcinoma again,
with his history of lung carcinoma and smoking history.  The
patient also had chest CT that demonstrated the mass around
his bronchus.  The patient could not tolerate either
bronchoscopy, which he was refusing anyway, and the patient
could not tolerate percutaneous biopsy.  The patient also
already has lung masses demonstrated on CAT scan.  The
patient decided to have comfort care measures initiated
during hospitalization.  The patient also gave sputum
samples.

3. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:  The patient's CK
and troponins were trending down and the patient refused
cardiac catheterization as he decided to have comfort
measures only in the setting of lung cancer.  The patient was
not started on heparin because of previous GI bleed that led
to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction when the patient
was on Lovenox.  The patient has 4+ MR so we tried to
increase ACE inhibitor though the patient did not have room
to move because of the blood pressure, so we continued
aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and statin.  The patient
was monitored on telemetry without event.

4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient was in sinus
rhythm throughout this day.  We continued amiodarone 200 once
a day and Lopressor.

5. Severe mitral regurgitation:  The patient tried to keep
ins and outs even, low sodium diet, and an ACE inhibitor.

6. GI bleed:  The patient had all stools guaiac tested.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable during the
hospitalization.  He had a b.i.d. proton pump inhibitor set
and increased amylase and lipase, possible pancreatitis.  The
patient reported no pain and the patient had a right upper
quadrant ultrasound that showed cholelithiasis.  The patient
did not want ERCP as he was comfort care only.  The patient
received one unit of packed red blood cells.

7. Ophthalmology:  The patient had home medications continued
without incident.

8. The patient had increased white blood cells which were
trending down over the hospitalization likely due to
steroids.

9. Disposition:  The patient was seen by physical therapy and
occupational therapy who helped with his movement.  The
patient had been in bed for three weeks.  The patient was
discharged to rehabilitation.  The patient chose DNR/DNI
during this hospitalization and comfort measures only which
were initiated with the help of [**Doctor Last Name 2270**] and we appreciate her
help.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 30 year old lady with unknown PMHx who was admitted
following multidrug ingestion. She was treated with valium for
alcohol withdrawal. Psychiatry was consulted who recommended
admission for dual diagnosis.
.
# Drug Overdose: Pt presented initially with overdose of
multiple drugs, including propranolol, quetiapine, sertraline,
chlorpromazine, and EtOH. Toxicology consulted in the ED and
recommended holding psych medications.  Pt required intubation
for one day, was extubated day prior to discharge.   After
extubation psychiatry team was consulted and patient was placed
under section 12 and 51a for intentional overdose while
intoxicated with high potential for re-attempt and recommended
bed search for dual diagnosis and 1:1 sitter.  Zoloft restarted
on day prior to discharge but seroquel and gabapentin continued
to be held at discharge, can be restarted while in psychiatry
unit as tolerated.  BP was stable off pressors during admission.
 Serial EKGs were done and showed no QRS or QTc prolongation.
.
# EtOH withdrawal: After extubation, patient exhibited symptoms
of alcohol withdrawal including shaking, diaphoresis,
hypertension and tachycardia.  Initially on CIWA scale with
diazepam 10 mg Q2H PRN CIWA >10 which was changed to lorazepam 4

CXR [**2194-7-28**]
There is mild postoperative widening of the superior
mediastinum. Heart size is normal. A pleural tube overlies
region of previous nodule in the left lower lung. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. ET tube, right jugular
introducer, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. The
tip of the endotracheal tube is probably less than 2 cm from
either the carina or the underside of the clavicles, with the
chin extended. Withdrawal of the tube by approximately 15 mm
would put it in optimal placement.

CXR [**2194-8-6**]
Nasogastric tube should be advanced at least 6 cm to move all
the side ports into the stomach. ET tube is in standard
placement. Moderate enlargement of the postoperative cardiac
silhouette is stable and unremarkable. There is no pleural
abnormality. Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**8-4**]. No
pleural abnormality.

ECHO [**2194-7-31**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
3. There is no pericardial effusion.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2194-7-10**],
there has been no significant change.

[**2194-7-28**] EKG
Normal sinus rhythm, without diagnostic abnormality


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] was electively admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-7-28**]
for surgical management of her coronary artery disease. She was
taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels. Postoperatively
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. The pulmonology service
was consulted for hypoxia. An echo was obtained which ruled out
tamponade. Subcutaneous heparin was started for pulmonary
embolism prophylaxis. As no ventilatory problems were
identified, other findings were consistent with pulmonary edema
and diuresis was optimized. She continued to be hypoxic and
BIPAP was started. She was transfused with red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. On postoperative day three, Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**]
was reintubated for respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy was
performed which showed normal airways and a bronchoalveolar
lavage was sent for culture. Vancomycin and Zosyn were started
given her fevers and she was pan cultured. A blood cultured
revealed coagulase negative staph in one bottle and she
clinically improved on antibiotics. Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] slowly weaned
from the ventilator and was again extubated on postoperative day
ten. Diuresis was continued. On postoperative day eleven, Ms.
[**Known lastname 32857**] was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. Her
drains and pacing wires were removed per protocol. Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**]
made slow but steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day fourteen. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an
outpatient.

CT chest/abd/pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. Two right lung masses; one located posteriorly in the right
upper lobe within the parenchyma, the other located in the right
hilum. It is unclear if the mass located in the parenchyma
represents primary tumor in the hilar mass, a nodal met. Other
nodes are located in the right hilum and within the mediastinum.
The appearance of these lesions are worrisome for lung
carcinoma.

weeks gestation with a birth weight of 3200 grams and was
admitted to the newborn intensive care unit from the newborn
nursery around 30 hours of life for management of
hyperbilirubinemia due to ABO incompatibility. The infant was
born to a 38 year old gravida V, para II, now [**Name (NI) 1105**] mother.
Prenatal screens included blood type O positive, antibody
screen negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, and group B Strep  status unknown.
The pregnancy was reportedly uncomplicated. No perinatal
sepsis risk factors. Delivery was by repeat cesarean section
on [**2168-6-17**]. Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5
minutes, respectively.

The infant was initially in the newborn nursery breast
feeding on day of birth with some formula supplement on day

ounces per feeding and tolerating them well, normal voiding
and stooling pattern.

On her examination the day after delivery, day of life #1,
she was noted to be jaundiced and a bilirubin was drawn and
was noted to be a total bilirubin of 17. Phototherapy was
started and 4 hours later the bilirubin was 18.7 with a
reticulocyte count of 21% and a hematocrit of 38%. She was
transferred to the newborn intensive care unit for continued
medical care.

GI: Was placed on triple phototherapy on admission with a
follow-up bilirubin total 15.6, direct 0.3. Bilirubin today
on [**2168-6-21**], was total 14.1, direct 0.3. She was changed
to phototherapy with a follow-up bilirubin about 12 hours
later that was decreased to a total of 13.4, direct 0.3.

Hematology: The baby's blood type is A positive, direct
Coombs positive. Her hematocrit on admission was 39% with a
reticulocyte count of 21%. Her hematocrit today on [**2168-6-21**], was 36.3%.

Infectious disease: No issues.

Neurology: Examination is age appropriate.

Sensory: Hearing screening has not been performed. Will need

18, creatinine of 1, platelets of 292, magnesium of 1.6, PO4
is 6.2, calcium 8.7.  AST 88, ALT of 44, LDH 231, alkaline
phosphatase 109.  T bilirubin of 0.7, lactate of 1.6.  CK 86
increased to 102, troponin 3.3, MB index of 9.8.

Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm, normal axis, left
ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial abnormality, ST changes
in precordial leads, ST depressions in V5 and V6, ST
elevations, normal intervals.  More pronounced when
tachycardic.

A transthoracic echocardiogram for this patient showed severe
aortic stenosis with approximate valve area of 0.7.  This was
followed by a cardiac catheterization on [**2116-5-11**] and found
to have a pulmonary capillary wedge of 14 with severe aortic
stenosis, mean gradient of 65 mm and a valve area of 0.54.
He also had diffuse coronary artery disease with 20% left
main, a 60% left anterior descending artery, a mid and
proximal circumflex lesion of approximately 30%, right
coronary artery of mid 40% and 100% distal right coronary
artery.

The patient did rule in for myocardial infarction.  CT Surgery
was consulted to assess for aortic valve replacement and CABG. CT
Surgery agreed that aortic valve replacement/CABG  was indicated
in this patient.
Preoperative evaluation revealed a 90-100% stenosis of the
right coronary artery. In view of the heavily calcified aorta and
therefore the need for circulatory arrest during surgery it was
felt that the risk of stroke was high and would require carotid
intervention prior to that. After careful review of the options
carotid stenting was recommended. This was successfully performed
on [**5-14**]. He was then put on aspirin and Plavix with
plans to wait two weeks for the surgery while controlling the
patient's heart failure on the floor.  Patient was extubated
and did well in the CCU.  He was transferred to the PCU
subsequently.
While in the PCU the patient had a recurrent episode of pulmonary
edema requiring transfer back to the CCU as well as reintubation
He also developed hemoptysis which was evaluated and felt to be
predominantly related to his CHF.An IABP was place on [**5-19**] to
optimize his hemodynamics and surgery was scheduled for [**5-21**].
Prior to the scheduled surgery the patient developed a
leukocytosis with gm + cocci in his sputum. The surgery was
cancelled by the cardiac surgical team and the patient evaluated
by ID. Antibiotic treatment was advised and their recommendations
followed. Although there was a concern about a positive blood
culture as well that was ultimately concluded to probably be a
contaminant.
The patient was successfully extubated on [**5-22**]. While in the CCU
the patient had some recurrent hemoptysis (evaluated by
pulmonary) and he began to develop renal insufficiency.On [**5-24**] he
was noted to have an ischemic left lower extremity despite being
on systemic heparin . He was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-
the IABP was removed. The renal service was also consulted due to
a rising creatinine and they felt that the acute renal failure
was possibly related to emboli from the IABP/aorta.CT surgery did
not feel there was any role for urgent cardiac surgery at this
time.

On the night of [**5-24**], patient developed high
grade transaminitis with AST and ALTs in the thousands, mild
scleral icterus with bilirubin approximately 1.5. Lactate was
initially stable throughout the night in the range of [**2-24**], but
then rose dramatically to 9.

In addition, the patient began to decompensate with
hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine and dopamine drips as
well as fluid boluses to maintain MAPS above 90.  He was also
having seizure-like activity and required increased doses of
Fentanyl, diazepam, and Haldol for sedation.

As the patient's condition deteriorated, CCU fellow and
attending were contact[**Name (NI) **] as well as Surgery to evaluate for a
possible mesenteric ischemia and acute abdomen.  The team was
united in feeling that any intervention at this time would be
a high risk of mortality and more likely that would not only
prolong an inevitable decline.  The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
told of the patient's grave prognosis and instructed to come
in as soon as possible.

Family arrived, and the seriousness of the condition and
prognosis were explained to them.  After discussion, the
family decided that it would not be consistent with the
wishes of Mr. [**Known lastname 22917**] to become dialysis dependent or
prolonged existence on a ventilator.  Spiritual counseling
was brought in the early morning of [**5-25**].  The family
decided to withdraw care.  Given the underlying medical
conditions, the Medical and Surgical teams involved fully
agreed with this decision.  Mr. [**Known lastname 22917**] passed away at 7:45 am
on [**5-25**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory arrest secondary to congestive
heart failure and renal failure.

HOSPITALIZATION DIAGNOSES:
1. Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Pneumonia.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with
akinesis of the septum and anterior wall. The distal LV and apex
are dyskinetic. The basal inferior wall moves best. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed (severe hypokinesis of the
distal RV free wall and PV apex). The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate
sized pericardial effusion. There are no definite
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 50891**] is a 76 year-old
male who was recently diagnosed with a submental meningioma
who was undergoing cardiac clearance prior to meningioma
excision and resection.  It should be noted that patient has
baseline schizophrenia and is very difficult to get to comply
with any kind of medical testing or treatment.  His son
obtained legal guardianship and was authorizing all his
medical care.  The patient was admitted on [**2138-8-29**] to the
cardiology service to undergo his preoperative clearance.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for meningioma,
paranoid schizophrenia, chronic renal insufficiency,
hypertension, angina, hypercholesterolemia, herpes Zoster,
urinary frequency, history of nephrolithiasis, history of
subtotal gastrectomy, bleeding ulcers, hemorrhoids,
peripheral neuropathy, spinal stenosis and homocystinuria.
His medications at home include Topomax 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Zocor, Atenolol, aspirin, vitamin B6, vitamin C, B12, vitamin
E, Lasix p.r.n., Proscar, ibuprofen, sublingual
nitroglycerin p.r.n. and folic acid.  He has no known drug
allergies.  He is divorced and a retired marine engineer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile with heart rate of 114
and blood pressure of 127/66.  He was in no apparent
distress.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, no masses.  Extremities were no clubbing or
cyanosis but did have bilateral edema.  Neurologically
cranial nerves 2 to 12 were intact but he did have baseline
paranoia and aggression.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit was 40.7, white count
ws 9.1, potassium of 4.2, BUN/creatinine 25/1.2.  His liver
function tests were all within normal limits.

Due to the patient's paranoid schizophrenia psychiatry was
also consulted and has been following along during his
hospital course.  Patient subsequently underwent a cardiac
stress test on [**2138-9-1**] which did not reveal any
electrocardiogram changes and patient did not reportedly
experience any angina. However, he continued to proceed with
his preoperative clearance and then undergoing cardiac
catheterization the following day which revealed 80 percent
PDA stenosis, 50 percent native RCA stenosis, 100 percent
proximal LAD stenosis and 100% mid circumflex disease and 70
percent OM1 disease.   Then patient was referred to cardiac
surgery to undergo coronary revascularization.  Patient
subsequently underwent coronary bypass grafting times three
on [**2138-9-5**].  He received a LIMA graft to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the OM1 and saphenous vein graft to
the PDA with a jump graft to the RPL.  Three vessels were
used for targets.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.  Patient was soon thereafter extubated and was
noted to be doing be doing well. The following day patient
experienced what seemed to be a seizure although the actual
seizure activity was unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] did receive a stat head CT
which did show any change from the previous films.  The
subfrontal hemangioma was still present but there was no new
hemorrhage, midline shift or any evidence of cerebrovascular
accident or any acute changes.  Neurology was consulted also
and patient was continued on Dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis.  On postoperative three patient continued to
remain stable after his event on postoperative day one and
was transferred to the floor.  On the floor critical therapy
was consulted.  Again patient was noted to be walking well
with assistance.  However, due to his baseline mental status
and paranoid schizophrenia patient required special attention
and care when ambulating out of his room.  His postoperative
course on the floor has been most notable for him refusing to
take medications.  With much effort and discussion and
explanation he has been agreeing to take his medications.
However, certain effort is required.  On postoperative day
four his Dilantin level was noted to be 7.7, his hematocrit
was 27.4.  The patient today is postoperative day five,
Dilantin remains 7.7 and he remains stable.  He is afebrile
with stable vital signs.  He has recently begun taking his
cardiac medications, again with explanation needed.  He has
not experienced any seizure activity since the one that
occurred on postoperative day number one.  Thus he is
currently awaiting a rehabilitation placement.  The plan is
the patient will go to rehabilitation for a few weeks until
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**], neurosurgeon, deems it appropriate to proceed
with excision of his meningioma.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft times four.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
Paranoid schizophrenia.
Hypertension.
Hypercholesterolemia.
Nephrolithiasis.

p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., B6 100 mg, B12 injections.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation.  He is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in
approximately two weeks.  Patient to continue to take
Dilantin at rehabilitation facility and continue to exert
effort in order to make patient comply with medications and
patient should be followed also by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**], neurosurgeon
here at [**Hospital1 69**].

HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 65915**], delivered at 37 weeks gestation,
was admitted to the newborn intensive care nursery for
management of hypoglycemia. Birth weight 2475 grams.

Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 65915**] delivered on [**2191-2-5**], to a 38 year
old gravida III, para 0, now I, mother. Prenatal screens
included blood type A negative, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, and group B strep
negative. The pregnancy was complicated by chronic
hypertension, hypothyroidism and microadenoma. Mother was
treated with labetalol, [**Name (NI) 27672**] and litho. Labor was induced
due to maternal hypertension at 37 weeks gestation. Due to
intolerance of labor, the baby was delivered by cesarean
section. The infant emerged with a good cry, was dry bulb
suctioned, pink in room air, Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1
and 5 minutes, respectively. During labor, there was no
maternal fever. Membranes were ruptured about 3 hours prior
to delivery for clear fluid.

In labor and delivery, the infant was noted to be hypothermic
and hypoglycemic. They fed him with improvement in his blood
glucose and he was admitted to the newborn intensive care
nursery for management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, an active, well
appearing infant in no distress. Head normocephalic. Anterior
fontanelle open, flat. Palate intact.
Red reflex deferred. Neck supple. Lungs clear bilaterally.
Regular rate and rhythm without murmur. Femoral pulses 2+
bilaterally. Normal male testes descended bilaterally. Anus
patent. Spine midline, no sacral dimple. Clavicles intact.
Hips stable. Neurologic: Good tone, normal suck and gag.
Extremities warm, well perfused with brisk capillary refill.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: The infant did not have any
respiratory distress, has remained in room air with
comfortable work of breathing.

Cardiovascular: Maintained normal blood pressure, heart rate
during hospital stay. Recent blood pressure 75/51 with a mean
of 58.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Required intravenous
therapy with D10W for hypoglycemia plus feeds of Enfamil 20
with iron every 3 hours. The IV fluid weaned gradually and
weaned off on [**2191-2-8**], at 0900. He has been feeding
every 3 hours of Enfamil 24 with iron plus attempting breast
feeding and breast milk as available. Blood glucoses have
been in the 60 to 90 range prior to feeds since the IV has
been out. He is voiding and stooling appropriately. Discharge
weight 2415 grams.

GI: Bilirubin on day of life 2 was total 7.3, direct 0.3,
remained slightly jaundiced. Follow-up bilirubin on [**2-9**] was
10.8/0.3/10.5.

Hematology: Hematocrit on admission 55%.

Infectious disease: As there were no sepsis risk factors and
hypoglycemia was partially explained by the infant's smaller
size and maternal hypertension, the infant received a CBC, no
blood culture and did not receive antibiotics. CBC was normal
with white count of 13.1, with 72 polys, zero bands,
platelets 158,000.

Neurology: Exam has been age appropriate.

Sensory: Hearing screening is pending.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable infant, feeding every 3
hours, maintaining blood glucose.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Transferred to newborn nursery.

was noted to have desaturations to the mid-80s requiring
nasal cannula O2. She weaned from her nasal cannula from a
maximum of 150 mL/min down to 25 cc over the next 4 days. She
transitioned to room air on [**2198-2-5**]. Chest x-ray was
obtained initially which was within normal limits, and a
repeat chest x-ray was performed on [**2198-2-5**] which also
was within normal limits. Infant has been stable in room air
for the last 48 hours.

CARDIOVASCULAR: No issues.

FLUID AND ELECTROLYTES: She was initially started on 60
cc/kg/D of D10W. Enteral feedings were initiated on day of
life #1. Infant has been ad lib p.o. feeding and
breastfeeding, taking in adequate amounts. Her discharge
weight is 4135 grams.

GI: Bilirubin on [**2-4**] was 6.6/0.2.

HEMATOLOGY: Hematocrit on admission was 52.1. Infant had not
required any blood transfusions.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were obtained on
admission in light of maternal sepsis risk factors.
Antibiotics were initiated, and at 48 hours blood cultures
remained negative, and antibiotics were discontinued. A
lumbar puncture was obtained which was within normal limits,
had a white count of 1, red blood cell count of 1, 52 for
protein, and 40 for glucose. Infant has been otherwise
stable.

NEURO: Has been appropriate for gestational age.

SENSORY: Hearing screen was performed with automated auditory
brain stem responses, and the infant passed.

History of Present Illness:
28M senior medical resident at [**Hospital1 18**] with GERD/gastritis
admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of malaria,
thrombocytopenia, and melena. Traveled to [**Country 74322**] for medical
work just over a week ago. Was well prior to his trip and was
prescribed atovaquone/proguanil for malaria prophylaxis at a
travel clinic appointment on [**8-29**]. His stopped in [**Country 74323**] on his
way to Kigale, [**Country 74322**] where he stayed for a day. He then
traveled to a rural area to work in a medical clinic. He stayed
in housing near his work site and drank boiled and filtered
water only. No swimming or needle sticks. Three days prior to
admission he developed fever, chills, fatigue, myalgias, mild
headache, and low back ache. He took two doses of ibuprofen for
fever. Finger stick testing for malaria showed ""1+"" parasites on
smear. He was begun on coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) for a
three day course. Within 24-48 hours his symptoms began to
subside. On the plane ride home, he had a 5-minute episode of
sharp non-radiating midepigastric pain associated with nausea
that resolved spontaneously. No neck stiffness, blurry vision,
chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea,
hematemesis, numbness, weakness, parasthesias, or confusion. He
began to notice petechiae scattered over his chest, arms, and
legs and came to the ED for further evaluation.
In the ED, initial VS 96.8 69 167/96 16 100%RA. Rapid malaria
antigen test negative for Plasmodium antigen. Had 2 episodes of
melena, each about [**12-29**] cup. The 2nd episode was streaked with a
small amount of bright red blood and associated with brief
lightheadeness. Given 1 bag platelets. Vital signs prior to

Brief Hospital Course:
28M h/o GERD/gastritis admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of
malaria, after presentation with headaches, myalgias, fevers, in
setting of travelling to Kigale, [**Country 74322**] for medical research. Pt
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room on [**2170-10-12**] and
also reported the development of thrombocytopenia and was noted
to have [**1-30**] melena bowel movements, and he was admitted to the
MICU. On HD#2 he was hemodynamically stable and his symptoms had
improved and he was transferred to a medicine floor. On [**10-14**],[**2169**], his symptoms had improved, appropriate treatment had
been initiated, and he was discharged to home in good condition,
ambulatory, with stable vital signs, and with appropriate
outpatient follow-up arranged. His brief hospital course was
notable for:
.
#Fever/thrombocytopenia/presumptive malaria: At presentation the
Pt reported that in [**Country 74322**] he had fingerstick for malaria that
showed 1+ parasites on smear. The Pt had been taking malaria
prophylaxis prior to his travel, and was only in the endemic
region for one day before his symptoms began. Although,
laboratory testing in this hospital did not definitively confirm
this diagnosis (negative rapid malaria antigen, negative thin
smears)it was believed that his initial symptoms of headaches,
fever, chills, and myalgias were from an infection with malaria,
most likely p.falciparum given the patterns of infection in
[**Country 74322**], and that since some treatement had already been
initiated (Pt was started on 3 day course of
artemether-lumefantrine, he was already partially treated. The
ID service was consulted and empiric treatment was started with
quinine. The Pt completed a three day course of quinine. Given
skin findings of petechiae, the Pt was also treated with
Ceftriaxone for Neisseria coverage, although there was low
suspicion of a Neisseria infection. The Pt had marked
improvement of his symptoms during his brief hospitalization and
at discharge did not complain of any headache, fever, chills, or
myalgias. He was discharged with a prescription to complete a 7
day course of Clindamycin, 600 mg, PO TID, and with outpatient
follow-up with the infectious disease service. Multiple blood
cultures and urine cultures were obtained which did not show any
other obvious sources of infection.
.
#Melena: During hospitalization the Pt had 2-3 episodes of
melena. Pt [**Name (NI) 61845**] were followed close daily, and although a
consent was obtained the Pt never required a transfusion.  On
HD#2 he underwent EGD, which revealed gastric petechiae without
bleeding, and no other abnormal findings. It was thought that
the petechiae were secondary to thrombocytopenia caused by the
plamodium parasite. The Pt was followed by the GI service who
reccommended outpatient follow up with flex sigmoidoscopy given
1 episode of BRBPR. The Pt did not have any melanotic stools
after the 2-3 episodes that he had at the time of presentation,
and at the time of discharge was hemodynamically stable.
.
#GERD:
While in the hospital, the Pt was treated with IV Omperazole for
GERD, in the setting of possible GI bleed. The Pt stated that he
had multiple omeprazole pills at home and that he did not need a
prescription for this medication upon discharge.
.
The Pt was discharged on [**10-14**], in good condition, with
stable vital signs, with appropriate outpatient follow-up
coordinated.

GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**11-13**]: Enteroscopy (EGD)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83977**] is a very pleasant 51-year old gentleman w/
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p XRT in [**2164**], known CAD s/p MI and PCI
x2, chronic asthma, HL and hypothyroidism who was admitted with
gastrointestinal bleeding. He reports wine-coloured stools for
the past couple of days. He has been worked up over the past 2
weeks for anemia and iron deficiency. He has previously had EGDs
and C-scopes that showed no lesions. Recent EGD [**2199-11-7**] showed
chronic gastritis but no source of bleeding. He was evaluated at
[**Hospital6 6640**] in [**Hospital6 **] and had CT abd which
showed thickened loops of jejunum in the LUQ. Additionally, he
underwent small bowel capsule study on [**11-7**] but results were
indeterminate. He was sent home but continued to have bloody
bowel movements.

On [**11-9**], He complained of dizziness, abdominal cramps and
wine-coloured stools. He re-presented to [**Hospital3 **] was
found to be hypotensive on exam, with a HCT of 22.3 (baseline
mid 30s). He required a total of 5 units of PRBC during his
hospital course (according to him, only 3 u recorded). He was
transferred to [**State 792**]Hospital for evaluation with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 67432**] to perform small bowel enteroscopy. A tagged RBC scan at
[**Hospital 792**]Hospital showed a potential bleeding source in the
proximal jejunum. Unfortunately, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67432**] had left to travel
abroad today so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for small bowel
enteroscopy with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. Due to his significant GI
bleed and question of hemodynamic stability, he was admitted to
the ICU.

In the ICU, he complains of some lower abdominal cramping and
foul-smelling dark maroon stools. He denies fevers, chills,
difficulty breathing, chest pain, changes in urinary function or
lower extremity swelling. He denies any history of hematemesis
or hemoptysis and reports a normal colonoscopy in [**2198**]. He
states this is the first time he has ever had GI bleeding of
this kind.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83977**] is a very pleasant 51 year-old gentleman who was
transferred from [**Hospital 792**]Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] for enteroscopy
to better characterize upper GI bleed, (localized to proximal
jejunum according to tagged RBC scan at [**Hospital **] Hospital) admitted to
ICU due to large volume blood loss and concerns for hemodynamic
instability.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:

1. GI BLEED- The likely source of Mr. [**Known lastname 83978**] bleed was upper
given nature and description of melenic stools and evidence of
source at proximal jejunum on tagged RBC scan. Possible causes
of bleed include peptic ulcer disease and NSAID-induced
gastritis from aspirin use, radiation enteritis from treatment
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (although he was treated in [**2164**]),
recurrent lymphoma and arteriovenous malformations. In the ICU,
he had decreasing hematocrits and one melenic bowel movement.
Gastroenterology service was notified of his admission and
general surgery was also contact[**Name (NI) **] so they could be aware of any
potential hemodynamic changes that would warrant surgical
intervention. He was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs on admission and
underwent enteroscopy on [**11-13**]. Enteroscopy did not reveal
source of bleed (just showed nodular stomach from old XRT) and
bleeding was thought to be due to an ateriorvenous malformation
that had blanched out. He underwent colonoscopy on [**11-14**] which
also did not reveal a bleeding source. He had grade III internal
hemorrhoids and a few polyps on colonoscopy. He was discharged
with GI follow-up in [**Location (un) 8545**]. He was instructed to take 81mg
of aspirin instead of 325mg due to bleeding risk.
Aspirin and home anti-hypertensive regimen were held on
admission due to GI bleed and close monitoring of hemodynamic
instability. Patient's hematocrit was carefully followed and he
did not require any further blood transfusions.

2. HYPERTENSION- Diltiazema and Toprol XL were held to active GI
bleeding in order to better characterize volume loss and
reciprocal tachycardia in response to hypotension. He will
confer with outpatient GI regarding when to restart these
medications.

3. HYPERLIPIDEMIA- simvastatin 10 daily was continued

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure being involved in your care, Mr. [**Known lastname 83977**]. You
were admitted to the ICU for GI bleeding and had an enteroscopy
to try to figure out the source of bleeding. The exact source of
bleeding was not found, and thought to be due to an AVM
(arteriovenous malformation). You also underwent colonoscopy. We
initially held your blood pressure medications because of GI
bleeding.

Your medications have not changed, but please ask your GI
doctors *(and cardiologist) whether to take 325mg or 81mg of
aspirin. (I would recommend taking 81mg) Also, double-check with
them about when to re-start your Diltiazem and Toprol XL. (we
held them initially as we often do for GI bleeds)

Please continue to take your other medications as you have been.

Call your doctor or 911 if you experience crushing chest pain,
difficulty breathing, fevers/chills, intractable nausea or
vomiting, dizziness from massive blood loss or severe bleeding
in your urine vomit or stool or any other concerning medical
problem.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your outpatient GI doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray not ordered.  Electrocardiogram not
ordered.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2200-9-18**].  He underwent an urgent arteriogram which showed an
occluded right femoral peroneal bypass [**Date Range **].  TPA was
started.  Repeat arteriogram on [**2200-9-19**] after TPA overnight
showed the proximal anastomosis of the right femoral to
peroneal bypass [**Date Range **] wide open all the way down to the level
of the distal anastomosis.  A small amount of blood clots
were noted in the distal [**Date Range **].  No outflow was identified.
A guidewire could not be passed into the peroneal artery.
TPA was continued.

Post angiogram, the patient developed bleeding and small
hematoma of the right groin around the sheath.  This was
treated by compression by the interventional radiology team.
TPA and heparin were discontinued.  It was felt that the
[**Date Range **] would reocclude without further thrombolytic treatment.
The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma,
cryoprecipitate and packed red blood cells.  Admission
hematocrit had been 40.  His post transfusion hematocrit was
32.  His fibrinogen level returned to [**Location 213**].  After the
sheaths were pulled, there was no further bleeding.  The
right groin hematoma was stable.  Ultrasound of the right
groin on [**2200-9-19**] showed no pseudoaneurysm.

The patient had severe pain in his right leg which required
oral Dilaudid for control.  He also received several doses of
intravenous Toradol with good effect.  The patient was
advised that his only option was a right below the knee
amputation.  He reluctantly agreed, but wanted to be
discharged home to take care of family issues.  The patient
agreed to return for surgery in approximately one to two
weeks after discharge.  He was given a prescription for
Percocet for pain control at time of discharge.

At time of discharge, the patient had an ecchymotic right
groin with a stable hematoma.  Femoral pulses were palpable
bilaterally.  He had a dopplerable right PT pulse.  There was
no dopplerable right DP pulse.  The patient had diminished
capillary refill of his toes.  His right fifth metatarsal
ulceration was dry and stable.

Date of Birth:   [**2097-7-1**]     Sex:  M

Service:  BLOOMGART

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old male
with history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on 3 liters home oxygen who continues to smoke, who presented
with severe shortness of breath on [**2157-12-4**].  Patient's
oxygen saturation was initially 82% on room air.  He improved
100% non-rebreather with an ABG at that time of 7.71/71/204.
Patient tried on BiPAP but ultimately required intubation and
Intensive Care Unit admission.

Per history, he complained of shortness of breath for one
month prior to admission with a productive cough for one week
prior to admission.  He denied fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, or chest pain.  Chest x-ray did not reveal any
acute infiltrate or failure.  However, temperature was 100.4
and admission white count of 11.8.

In addition, patient gives history of multiple sick contacts
with grandchildren with the flu.

In the Emergency Room patient received p.o. Azithromycin and
Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously and was subsequently
admitted to the MICU, where he was continued on intravenous
steroids and antibiotics until extubation on [**2157-12-7**].  He
was then continued on p.o. steroids, continued on a course of
Azithromycin, and called out to the floor.

Of note, he had a troponin peak of 0.51 attributed to demand
ischemia while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He
continued to receive his daily aspirin, but his beta blocker
was held secondary to his chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare.  This medication was added back on [**2157-12-8**].

During his stay in the MICU he was evaluated for failure to
thrive with a CT of the chest which was negative for
malignancy considering his history of tobacco use.  A
Nutrition consult was obtained, and he was administered
parenteral nutrition while intubated considering his history
of not eating for weeks prior to admission.  Also during his
MICU stay, he was noted to have 20 beats of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 3 liters home
O2.  No history of intubation; however, history of multiple
steroid tapers, greater than 10 per year.
2.  Low back pain.
3.  Rheumatoid arthritis treated in the past, currently now
off any treatments.
4.  No history of coronary artery disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with history of coronary artery
disease with first myocardial infarction at age of 52.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive one pack per day.  No alcohol.
Patient lives with four grandchildren, all of whom have
recently had the flu.  He also lives with his daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] is disabled secondary to his severe lung disease.  In
the past he worked detailing cars.

LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  White count on call out to
the floor 14.4, hematocrit 36.1, Chem-10 notable for a
potassium of 3.4, bicarbonate of 30.  Serial cardiac enzymes:
CK-MB ranged from 6 to 12, troponin T peaked at 0.51 but
subsequently trended down.

Echo on [**2157-12-7**] showed an ejection fraction of 45%,
pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 37, basal inferior, mid
inferior, basal and mid inferolateral akinesis, and 3+ mitral
regurgitation 0.8%.  Iron 41, TIBC 230, B12 815, folate 4.5.

EKG at admission:  Sinus tachycardia at 138 beats per minute
with some left axis deviation compared to old EKG, normal
intervals, left atrial enlargement, low voltages, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression in V5 which resolved on repeat EKG.

Chest x-ray:  No acute infiltrate, lungs hyperinflated,
calcified pleural plaque at the left lung bases, emphysema.

CT of the chest negative for a malignancy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 60-year-old male with history of
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 3 liters home
oxygen who presented on [**2157-12-4**] with severe shortness of
breath diagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation requiring intubation.  During the course of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay he was extubated and converted to
p.o. steroids with stabilization of his symptoms.

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  Patient
initially presented with an O2 sat of 82% on room air.  He
was placed on 100% non-rebreather.  However, he developed a
respiratory alkalosis.  A trial BiPAP was initiated, but
patient failed and ultimately was intubated.  He received 125
mg intravenous Solu-Medrol and one dose of p.o. Azithromycin
in the Emergency Room and was subsequently admitted to the
MICU where he was continued on intravenous steroids and
antibiotics until extubation on [**2157-12-7**], at which time he
was converted to p.o. steroids and continued to complete a
five-day course of Azithromycin.

Patient with multiple sick contacts, living with four
grandchildren, all of whom have recently had the flu; thus,
patient continued on droplet precautions as influenza likely
the precipitator of his COPD exacerbation.

Following call out to the floor, patient continued on
Albuterol and Atrovent.  He was discharged with a p.o.
steroid taper in addition to a prescription for one week of
Ativan as he developed some symptoms of increasing dyspnea
prior to discharge thought to be attributed to anxiety.
Patient discharged on his home 3 liters of supplemental
oxygen with strong urging to cease further tobacco use.

2.  Cardiac ischemia:  Patient with troponin peak of 0.51
attributed to demand ischemia in the context of tachycardia
and hypoxia.  Troponin subsequently trended down and CK-MB
remained within normal limits.  Patient continued on daily
aspirin and his beta blocker was restarted upon call out to
the floor.  It was initially held secondary to COPD
exacerbation.

Hospital records obtained from patient's primary care
physician office show no evidence of history of coronary
artery disease.  Patient is to follow up with his primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] is also noted to be a cardiologist, for
continued follow up and possible exercise stress test.

Patient cannot be currently stressed secondary to acute COPD
flare.

3.  Episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia:
Patient with history of 20 beats nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia while in the MICU.  Patient continued on
telemetry following call out to the floor.

Patient continued to have episodes of four to five beats
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He was asymptomatic
during these episodes.  A beta blocker was added following
call out to the floor and no further events were seen.  Of note,
patient with ejection fraction greater than 30%, thus no
indication for pacemaker and pt not interested in further workup
for this .

4.  Failure to thrive:  Patient presents with history of poor
p.o. intake times weeks prior to admission.  A chest CT was
negative for lung cancer.  A Nutrition consult was obtained.
Patient received parenteral nutrition while intubated, and
good p.o. was encouraged following extubation with
supplemental Boost and Neutro-Phosphate supplementation.

Patient noted to have an ejection fraction of 45% with 3+
mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram obtained during this
admission.  Intravenous fluids were administered with
caution.  Patient's blood pressure was carefully controlled
with a beta blocker.  His blood pressures did not permit the
addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

Patient maintained on a regular sliding scale insulin p.r.n.

5.  Elevated white count likely secondary to steroids:
Patient without signs or symptoms of infection other than
history of probable influenza exposure on droplet
precautions.

6.  Normocytic anemia:  Primary care physician not available
to discuss regarding the duration of patient's anemia.
Reticulocyte count was obtained and noted to be low.
However, the remainder of patient's CBC is within normal
limits, so unlikely this is secondary to bone marrow
involvement.  Patient instructed to follow up with his
primary care physician as this may simply be secondary to
increased white blood cells due to steroid administration.
Of note, patient's folate, B12, TSH, and iron studies were
checked this admission and found to be within normal limits.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2.  Demand ischemia.
3.  Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good; patient satting well on home 3
liters supplemental oxygen; cleared by Physical Therapy.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged home with VNA and home oxygen.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Albuterol 90 mcg, two inhalations, q. 4 to 6 hours p.r.n.
shortness of breath or wheezing.
4.  Bupropion 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. for smoking cessation.
5.  Multivitamin, one, p.o. q. day.

Chief Complaint:
left knee pain, nonunion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-15**]: Revision Left total knee arthroplasty with distal femoral
replacement and hardware removal


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19704**] is a very pleasant 76-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, gout, hypothyroidism and bilateral knee
osteoarthritis treated with total knee replacement in [**2087**].
She sustained a left distal femoral periprosthetic fracture
in [**2099-10-29**]. This was treated with open reduction and
internal fixation with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 101**] plate by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Despite
anatomic reduction, a nonunion developed at the distal femoral
fracture
site.
She was experiencing ongoing distal femoral pain while
ambulating. CT was consistent with a nonunion. Preoperative knee
aspiration confirms no evidence of infection and ESR and CRP
were normal. The decision was made to proceed with a revision
total knee replacement with resection of the fractured distal
femur and reconstruction with a distal femoral replacement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 52-year-old female
with a past medical history of pneumonia, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and a history of tuberculosis exposure
with a negative PPD on [**2142-8-19**], who presented to her
primary care physician for [**Name9 (PRE) 102715**] symptoms.  She was
treated as an outpatient with levofloxacin; however, her
symptoms continued to worsen.  On [**2142-8-18**], the patient
went to an outside hospital with an oxygen requirement and a
white blood cell count of 13.8.  The patient was admitted and
started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, as well as levofloxacin
and doxycycline.  At the outside hospital, the patient had a
bronchoscopy performed which showed no masses, negative
bronchoalveolar lavage for acid fast bacilli, Chlamydia,
Legionella.  The patient was subsequently intubated for an
oxygen requirement and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for a lung biopsy.

The patient was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
during her stay there on [**2142-8-21**] to [**2142-8-28**].  On
admission, the patient was thought to have a
community-acquired pneumonia which caused the oxygen
requirement but also the possibility of an interstitial
process.  The patient was started on ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and Levaquin for probable community-acquired
pneumonia.  A CT scan was performed which showed evidence of
an infectious process bilaterally and some pulmonary edema.

On [**2142-8-22**], the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service was
consulted to perform a lung biopsy.  The right middle lobe
was biopsied which showed adult respiratory distress syndrome
in the exudative phase.  The patient continued to improve and
was extubated on [**2142-8-23**].  At that time, her oxygen
requirement was three liters for 97 percent oxygenation.  An
echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection
fraction of 65 percent in an otherwise normal heart.

The [**Hospital 228**] medical Intensive Care Unit stay was
complicated by agitation and confusion after her extubation.
Psychiatry was consulted, and the patient was found to have a
history of drug abuse and alcohol abuse.  There was concern
that she may have gone through withdrawal, and also this
could be delirium secondary to sedation.

The patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for
several days.  Her symptoms improved.  She required less

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in an assist living home.
The patient denied alcohol, smoking, or elicit drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Blood pressure 129/66; heart rate 108; respiratory rate 18;
temperature 102.8; oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.
GENERAL:  The patient was a somnolent, but arousable,
disoriented man in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Examination
revealed the right pupil opacified with left pupil, which was
minimally reactive.  Poor dentition was noted.  The patient
had 2+ carotids with no bruit.  There was evidence of
lymphadenopathy.  Neck stiff was equivocal.  LUNGS:  On
examination the patient gave a poor effort, but faint
crackles were heard at the right base with no wheezes
appreciated.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no extra heart sounds audible.  ABDOMEN:
Examination revealed soft, nontender, nondistended belly with
normal bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  Examination revealed 3+
pitting edema bilaterally.  The patient has an A-V fistula in
the right arm.  The patient had erythema and tenderness, as
well as swelling and warmth over his MCP joints bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination revealed no focal signs.

LABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the white blood cell of 22.5,
hematocrit 42.8, platelet count 209.  Urinalysis revealed the
glucose of 500, no red cells, and no white cells.

Chemistry panel revealed the glucose of 646, creatinine of
2.2.  The initial CK was 265 with MB of 7 and a troponin of
2.0.  The patient's blood was positive for acetone.  The CSF
analysis revealed glucose of 270, two white blood cells, 40
protein, and negative gram stain.

Chest x-ray:  Portable chest x-ray was done and revealed poor
inspiration, but no active cardiopulmonary process.

The EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute,
axis -30, normal intervals, small Qs in V1 and V2 consistent
with an old anteroseptal infarct, no significant change from
a previous [**2139-11-27**] EKG.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 50-year-old man
with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
end-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant times
two, who present with hyperglycemia volume depletion,
metabolic acidosis, with positive serum ketones secondary to
likely diabetic ketoacidosis.  The patient was also febrile
with elevated white blood cell count and tender MCP joints
suggesting the diagnosis of cellulitis versus gout.

#1.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was started on insulin drip for
a diabetic ketoacidosis in order to keep his blood sugars
between 100 and 200.  The patient was eventually transitioned
to a regular insulin sliding scale.  The patient's
hemodynamics were followed closely.  Vigorous fluid hydration
was pursued.  The patient was gradually transitioned to p.o.
hydration and his diet was advanced.  The patient's anion gap
closed quickly.  The patient was eventually transferred to
the floor, where he was maintained on his regimen of ultra
Lente 8 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and q.p.m. as well as a
regular insulin sliding scale.  The patient's blood sugars
remained elevated in the 300s, likely secondary to the fact
that he was receiving steroids.

As the patient was gradually tapered down on steroids, it was
thought that his glycemic control would improve.

#2.  RENAL:  The patient has a history of end-stage renal
disease, status post renal transplant times two, with an
elevated creatinine likely secondary to volume depletion from
diabetic ketoacidosis.  The patient's creatinine rapidly
returned to baseline with vigorous fluid hydration.  The
patient did transiently become hyponatremia, but responded
well to p.o. free water.

The patient's electrolytes were monitored and repleted as
necessary.  The patient was gradually restarted on his
outpatient diuretic regimen of Zaroxolyn and Lasix.  Prograf
levels were checked in order to maintain adequate
immunosuppression.

3.  RHEUMATOLOGIC:  The patient presented with history of
gout and onset of swollen, painful, MCP joints.  Rheumatology
and Infectious disease were both consulted.  The differential
included gout exacerbation versus septic arthritis.  The
patient was started on Ceftriaxone 1-g IV q12h. and
Vancomycin 1-g q.18. for treatment of suspected septic
arthritis.  The patient's joints were tapped by the
Department of Rheumatology and did not reveal positive
cultures.  Blood cultures revealed no growth by the time of
this dictation.  The patient was aimed to receive a 7-day
treatment course.  The patient was also started on Prednisone
for management of his gouty exacerbation.  Symptoms improved
rapidly and he noted decreased pain and increased mobility of
his hands.

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient initially presented with
elevated troponin in the setting of negative creatinine
kinases, suggesting possible demand ischemia related to the
patient's diabetic ketoacidosis and volume depletion.  Also,
the troponin may have been elevated secondary to acute renal
failure.  The patient was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  He eventually ruled out for myocardial infarction.
However, the fact that the patient did have some evidence of
myocardial leak, suggested that he may need an outpatient
stress perfusion test in the future to evaluate for ischemia.

5.  GI:  The patient developed loose, watery stools, while in
the Intensive Care Unit, and then upon arrival to the floor.
It was thought that this may be related to antibiotics, as
well as the possibility of C. difficile colitis.  C.
difficile toxins were sent, as well as stool for culture and
fecal leukocytes.

6.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

with his primary care physician and nephrologist, Dr. [**Known firstname **]

cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname 3082**].

POST-BYPASS:

Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intcat thoracic aorta.
The bioprosthesis in the aortic position is stable and
functioning well with peak and mean gradient of 12 and 4 mm of

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2108-12-13**] where
the patient underwent aortic valve replacement.  See operative
report for full details.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  The patient developed post-operative
atrial fibrillation which was managed with beta blocker and
coumadin.  EP consulted and recommended not starting amiodarone
due to a prolonged PR and RBBB.  The patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4, the patient deconditioned, but ambulating, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.

Chief Complaint:
Esophageal varicies

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79 yo woman w/ h/o primary biliary cirrhosis complicated by
portal hypertension, Grade III-IV esophageal varices, who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU today for actively bleeding esophageal

varices.

She had recently undergone thoracentesis in mid-[**Month (only) **] for
dyspnea,
which revealed 1200cc of transudative pleural fluid and on [**7-26**]
she underwent VATS procedure and lung biopsy for question of
pulmonary fibrosis. She was discharged home on [**2142-7-31**].

The patient was readmitted to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital [**2142-8-1**]
when she developed hematemesis with initial BP recorded 80/30.
She was resuscitated with IV fluids, given sandostatin and
levofloxacin for prophylaxis, and transfused with red blood
cells
and fresh frozen plasma. An attempt at banding was made there
with sclerotherapy, but she became hypotensive to 50 systolic.
She was reportedly never pulseless. She was subsequently
intubated and started on pressors and 30 minutes later her
BP was up to 130 systolic. Endoscopy continued with further
injections. Her hematocrit at 3pm was 44% but she was noted to
be
unresponsive since endosopy. She was observed to open her eyes
spontaneously but not follow commands. She was thought to have
twitching of the right face and rigidity of the right arm and
also some fixed rightward eye deviation. She was also thought to

be moving her left side less than her right side. She was
started
on propofol gtt and then given a load of dilantin 1200mg. She
also did received 2mg iv ativan at 1600 for a questionable 3
minute period of ""activity"". Otherwise, no paralytics, no other
benzodiazepines, or other opioids have been given today.

She was transferred here to the MICU on pressors.

probable bilateral uncal herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
MrsInitial plan was to EGD and assess status of esophageal
varicies. However, given the finding of the blown pupil, and ?
seizure activty and unresponsiveness, it was decided to first CT
head. Ct showed a large right sided hypodensity in the
distribution of the right middle cerebral artery with subfalcine
herniation and
midline shift of about 5mm, near obliteration of the right
lateral ventricles, presence of hyperdensities in the bilateral
basal ganglia, obliteration of the prepontine cistern and
probable bilateral uncal herniation.
Given this finding, neurology was consulted. They performed a
complete neuro exam including cold calorics which demonstrated
absence of any brainstem reflexes.
Family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of the situation and
prognosis.
Family arrived in the morning and it was decided that the
patient would not have wanted any further interventions. Care
was withdrawn in the morning, and the patient expired.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following his cardiac cath on [**12-24**] which showed severe coronary
artery disease he was admitted for surgical work-up for pending
surgery. On [**12-25**] he was brought to the operating room where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta blockers and diuretics
were started and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. On post-op day one his chest tubes were removed and he
was transferred to the telemetry floor to begin increasing his
activity level. He had intermittent Atrial fibrillation and was
treated with amiodarone with conversion to SR. No Coumadin was
indicated as patient was not in prolonged atrial fibrillation.
Pacing wires removed per protocol.  He continued to make good
progress tolerating a full po diet, ambulating in the halls
without difficulty and his incisions were healing well. He was
cleared for discharge to home with VNA on POD # 4. All follow up
appointments were advised.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] is a 1-day-old full-
term infant who is being transferred from the neonatal
intensive care unit to the regular newborn nursery at [**Hospital6 1760**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] was born on
[**2104-12-1**], at approximately 3 p.m. as a 3105 g
product of a 39-week gestation pregnancy to a 36-year-old,
gravida 2, para 0, now 1, mother, with an [**Name (NI) 37516**] of [**2104-12-8**]. Prenatal laboratory studies were notable for blood type
O+, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative,
rubella non-immune, RPR nonreactive, and group B strep
negative. Maternal issues notable for asthma and depression
treated with Prozac at 20 mg daily. Pregnancy was reportedly
uncomplicated with normal fetal ultrasounds.

Intrapartum course was notable for 1 episode of fetal
bradycardia during labor. It resolved with repositioning.
However, at the onset of final stage of labor and pushing,
sustained fetal bradycardia to 60-70 was noted that
eventually prompted an emergent cesarean section delivery.
Onset of bradycardia was approximately 11 minutes prior to
delivery. No sepsis risk factors were noted and labor was
otherwise reportedly uncomplicated. At delivery the infant
emerged stunned requiring vigorous stimulation, as well as
positive-pressure ventilation with a bag and mask. Tone and
respiratory effort gradually improved. Heart rate remained
good at 100 throughout. By 10 minutes of life, the infant was
breathing spontaneously but had overall decreased tone and
activity and was noted to have increased work of breathing.
The infant was subsequently brought to the NICU receiving
facial CPAP therapy. Apgar scores were 4, 7 and 7.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 3105 g, head circumference 33
cm, length 40.5 cm. Initial temperature is 100.3,
subsequently normalizing at 99.2. Heart rate in the 140s.
Mean blood pressures were in the 40s. Oxygen saturation
greater than 95% on room air. The infant was well-developed
with steadily improving spontaneous activity. Skin was warm
and dry. Lungs were coarse with poor aeration that also
improved rapidly. Initial grunting and retractions were noted
that resolved within the first 1-2 hours of life. Heart exam
was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Abdomen was soft
without hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses were 2+. Profusion
was mildly reduced. Tone was initially increased with mild
jitteriness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory: The infant was noted to have mildly
    increased work of breathing on admission to the NICU,
    although oxygen saturations remained greater than 95% in
    room air throughout. Respiratory status gradually
    improved and within 1-2 hours of life, the infant was
    breathing comfortably in room air. No further
    respiratory issues were noted throughout hospitalization
    in the NICU. A chest x-ray was obtained and this was
    largely clear with mild streaking consistent with
    retained fluid.  No pneumothorax was noted.
2. Cardiovascular: The infant remained hemodynamically
    stable with appropriate vital signs throughout
    admission. One normal saline bolus was given on
    admission for decreased profusion with improvement.
3. FEN: Initial D-stick was greater than 100. The infant
    was initially started on maintenance IV fluids at D10W
    at 60 ml/kg/day. By approximately 10 hours of life, the
    infant's status had steadily improved and the infant was
    begun on ad lib oral feedings. The infant fed well
    taking Enfamil 20, 30-40 ml per feed and IV fluids were
    discontinued. At the time of transfer, the infant
    continues to feed well with stable blood sugars off of
    IV fluids. Of note, cord blood gases revealed a pH of
    7.00. initial arterial blood gas on admission to the
    NICU revealed a pH of 7.29, pCO2 of 45, pO2 of 74 and
    bicarbonate of 23.
4. ID: Initial CBC and blood culture were sent on
    admission. CBC revealed a white count of 13.5 with 26%
    polys and 0% bands. Hematocrit was 50 and platelets were
    307. Blood culture was sent and remains negative to
    date. Antibiotics were not begun.
5. Neurologic: Initial exam on admission to the NICU showed
    a somewhat hypertonic infant that was also appeared
    jittery. Overall activity was reduced. Neurologic exam
    improved steadily and by the time of transfer, the
    infant is comfortable with appropriate tone and
    activity. Neurologic exam at transfer is basically
    normal.

DISPOSITION:  With resolution of respiratory distress,
adequate feeding and stable temperatures in a crib, the
infant was being transferred to the regular nursery for
further care.

PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) **]. The infant will
be followed by the [**Doctor Last Name 46742**] Newborn Service in the nursery.

CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Feeds: Enfamil 20 and/or breast milk on an ad lib basis.
2. Medications: None.
3. State newborn screen has not been sent.
4. The infant has not received any immunizations.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Thirty-nine week term infant.
2. Neonatal depression, mild.
3. Evaluation for sepsis.
4. Transient tachypnea of the newborn.

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77230**] is an 87F with a PMH s/f CHF with an EF of 30%, A fib
s/p pacemaker not anticoagulated, on home O2 who presented on
[**2193-8-24**] after developing acute onset of shortness of breath
with a new O2 requirement (her baseline is 92% on 2L, and she
was requiring 6L NC to maintain sats).  Otherwise her ROS was
negative.  She ruled out for an MI by enzymes.  The team
attempted to diurese her for a presumed CHF exacerbation based
on her CXR findings of cephalization and pleural effusions, they
anticoagulated her for suspicion for a PE and a chads score of
4, and put her in for an echo and CTA of the chest.  Initially
her hemodynamics improved with diuresis, with a decrease in her
creatinine, so the team attempted further diuresis today.  She
has recieved a total of 160mg of IV lasix, and has put out
approximately 1100cc of urine.
Today the patient was noted to drop her sats to 70s on room air
whenever she would take her face mask off.  She was in no acute
respiratory distress, and was mentating well with this.  An ABG
was obtained which showed 7.44/41/48.  She was taken down for a
STAT CTA, and transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77230**] is an 87F with a PMH s/f chronic systolic HF (EF
30%), afib off coumadin, with baseline home O2 requirement who
presents with acute worsening of dyspnea and new oxygen
requirement.

1)Respiratory distress: Likely CHF exacerbation given Chest
X-ray findings. She is normally on 2L of O2 at home, which
increased to 6L during her hospital stay. She received 160mg IV
Lasix on the floor with 2L of urine output. In the MICU, she
received an additional 80mg IV. Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her oxygen requirements continued to improve with diuresis. On
the day of discharge, she was at baseline of 2 liters and
satting at 90-91%. She had been adequately diuresed and it was
felt that low baseline saturations were likely secondary to
bibasilar atelectasis as identified on Chest CT. Her home Lasix
dose was increased and she was discharged on 60mg PO BID, (vs
40mg PO BID on admission). Clinically she appeared euvolemic at
the time of discharge. Discharged with instruction to encourage
ambulation, incentive spirometry to improve air movement.

2)Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.5; elevated
to 2.0 on admission.
Her Cr was monitored closely and her medications were renally
dosed. Her creatinine stabilized at 1.7 and it was felt that
this liekly represents new baseline creatinine for her.

3)Chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure: Patient was diuresed
as above. Losartan was held in light of elevated creatinine, but
restarted prior to discharge. She was continued on beta-blocker.
ECHO showed improvement of global systolic function with EF of
50-55%, improved from [**2193-1-10**] Echo with 30% EF.

4)HTN: She was continued on home regimen of Amlodipine and
Metoprolol.

5)Atrial fibrillation: s/p pacemaker. She is not on
anticoagulation as an outpatient. She was continued on
beta-blocker for rate control. Her outpatient PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 15303**]
rehab was contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was recommended that anticoagulation
be initiated for atrial fibrillation.He will investigate why
this was not previosuly done and consider starting. No
anticoagulation was started while inpatient.

6)Dementia: Continued on Aricept and Namenda.

7)Hypothyroidism: Continued on Levothyroxine.

8)DM type II: Patient is on Glipizide as outpatient; this was
held in light of her acute renal failure. She was placed on an
insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control. Prior to
discharge, glipizide was restarted at home dose.

9)Gout: Continued on Allopurinol which was renally dosed.

10)Depression: Continued on Paxil.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, sore throat and confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 41 year-old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary
artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, antiphospholipid
syndrome, scleroderma, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, and
diastolic congestive heart failure initially presented to
[**Hospital1 69**] for fever and change in
mental status on [**2151-12-13**].  While on the medical floor the
plan was to do a lumbar puncture, however, the patient was
found to have a high INR so she needed to be transfused with
4 units of fresh frozen platelets prior to the lumbar
puncture.  After receiving the 4 units of fresh frozen
platelets, the patient began having difficulty breathing
secondary to pulmonary edema.  Therefore on [**2151-12-14**] she was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a BiPAP.
While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was diuresed and
then weaned down to nasal cannula oxygen.  The lumbar
puncture was eventually performed, which was negative.  A CT
of the chest was done, revealing bilateral lower lobe opacity
consistent with pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema.  The
patient was started on Levaquin.  Infectious disease consult
team then recommended Doxycycline for Ehrlichiosis.
Vancomycin and Zosyn was also recommended for nasochromial
pneumonia coverage.  Her last fever was on [**2151-12-19**] morning
with a temperature of 102 Fahrenheit.  On [**2151-12-20**] the
patient was then transferred back to the medical floor.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL FLOOR FROM
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Temperature 97.3.  Blood pressure
138/78.  Pulse 84.  Respiratory rate 20. 96% on 3.5 liters
O2.  HEENT eyes are anicteric.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.  There are some pustules
on the hard palette.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy.
 Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.
No murmurs or thrills noted.  Chest decreased breath sounds
at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.  Neurologically, cranial
nerves II through XII.  Alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 5.2,
hematocrit 24.6, platelets 250, sodium 140, potassium 4.2,
chloride 104, bicarb 23, BUN 70, creatinine 2.4, glucose 353,
albumin 3, calcium 8.7, magnesium 2, PT 424.7, PTT 68.5, INR
4.  Microbiology tests revealed Legionella and microplasm
were negative.  Urine culture on [**12-19**] is negative.  Blood
culture on [**12-19**] is pending.  Throat culture shows no strep
or gram C.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  In regard to the
patient's diastolic congestive heart failure she was
continued on her treatment with beta blockers.  As far as her
coronary artery disease the patient was continued on
secondary prevention with aspirin, beta blocker and a statin.
Her blood pressure was well controlled in the 130s with
Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.  The patient did have an episode of
feeling lightheaded with decreased blood pressures so her
Cozaar and Hydrochlorothiazide were never restarted.

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient finished her seven day
course of Doxycycline for possible Ehrlichiosis.  As for her
community and Nasochromial pneumonia, the patient was
initially continued on the regimen of Vancomycin, Zosyn, and
Flagyl.  By day of discharge her Vancomycin and Flagyl were
discontinued.  It was felt that a two week course of Levaquin
at 250 mg po q day and Augmentin 500 mg po b.i.d. would be
enough to cover the pneumonia.  Mycoplasma serum antibodies
were checked and are pending.  Attempts were made to do
obtain a nasopharyngeal wash collection for viruses.
However, given the fact that the patient recently had some
nasal pluggings removed by ENT that was initially placed for
a nose bleed, we were unable to obtain the nasopharyngeal
washings.  The patient did have diarrhea one day prior to
discharge, so Clostridium difficile ASA was sent.  The
Clostridium difficile was negative.

3.  Renal:  The patient does have chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to diabetes mellitus with a creatinine baseline at
2.1.  Her creatinine during the hospital resumed back to
baseline at 2 to 2.1.

4.  Hematology:  On transfer to the medical flor the patient
was found to be anemic, so she was given 2 units of packed
red blood cells.  Her epoetin shots were restarted.
Hematocrit was followed on a daily basis.  Iron studies were
sent, but are still pending upon discharge.

5.  Endocrine:  For management of the diabetes mellitus, the
patient was continued on only half of her normal regimen
given the fact that her po intake was not at her normal
level.  She was managed on Glargine 36 units at night and NPH
13 units in the morning, being covered by a Humalog sliding
scale.  The patient did have an event of hyperglycemia for
refusal of taking her NPH dose in the morning.  Her [**Last Name (un) **]
doctors did [**Name5 (PTitle) **] by to consult and recommended that the
patient should be taking the NPH despite the fact that the
sugars may be within reasonable levels in the morning.

6.  Rheumatology:  The patient had a rash that may be
associated with her scleroderma.  She was encouraged to
follow up with her rheumatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as needed.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Sepsis and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old male
with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer with
metastatic disease to the lung complicated by esophageal
fistula, esophagectomy, deep vein thrombosis, and recent
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 2910**]
earlier on the day of admission with complaints of increasing
weakness, decreased po intake, mild abdominal pain and
dehydration plus some shortness of breath over the past week.
He also reported a cough productive of whitish-yellow sputum,
and decreased frequency of urination.  He denied any fevers,
chills, headache, chest pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or
dysuria.  He reports that he is only able to take one can of
feeding through his J tube each day.

At the outside hospital, his white blood cell count was 20.
His chest x-ray showed findings consistent with congestive
heart failure or right upper lobe pneumonia.  Vital signs on
presentation at [**Hospital6 **] were a heart rate of 112,
blood pressure 60/palp, respiratory rate of 16 and an oxygen
saturation of 95% on room air.  He was given two liters of
saline intravenously and his pressure came up to 105/57.  He
was treated with 60 mg of intravenous Solu-Medrol as well as
500 mg of Levaquin intravenously.  He was then transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for further evaluation.

On presentation in the Emergency Department, his temperature
was 96.9.  Heart rate 110. Blood pressure 105/70.
Respiratory rate between 18-20.  In the Emergency Room, he
was evaluated and intravenous fluid boluses were given for
his hypotension. It was noted that he had worsening
respiratory distress and his oxygen saturations diminished to
the 60% range on 100% nonrebreather.  He was then electively
intubated for increasing respiratory distress.  Blood
cultures were sent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer treated with surgery
and x-ray therapy; he had right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis; two prior strokes with residual right lower
extremity weakness; abdominal aortic aneurysm; esophageal
fistula; Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
infection; motor vehicle accident [**2131-1-13**] fracture; J
tube insertion after sepsis episode; chronic lower back pain
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bactrim Double Strength 1 tablet po q.d.
2.  Percocet.
3.  Reglan 10 mg twice a day.
4.  Combivent inhaler b.i.d.
5.  Ritalin b.i.d.
6.  >....<MDI b.i.d.
7.  Remeron 30 mg once a day.
8.  Celexa 40 mg q.h.s.
9.  Dilomine 30 mg once a day.
10. Darvocet prn.
11. Vistaril 25 mg q. 6 hours prn.
12. Decadron 2 mg b.i.d.
13. Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneous q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He had a 60 pack year history of smoking and
lives with his wife.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan
which showed no evidence of intraabdominal abscess, focus of
infection, or a perforation.  The CT scan did show a moderate
sized pericardial effusion.  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and upon arrival, patient was
noted minutes later to become hypotensive with a mean blood
pressure of 40 and was then noted to have a cardiac arrest
with pulseless electrical activity.  CPR was immediately
initiated, and 1 mg of epinephrine was given.  The Doppler
probe was then used to ascertain that a pulse was present and
the patient was started on intravenous pressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Neo-Synephrine drip was started and this brought the blood
pressure back up into an acceptable range.  At this point,
the Cardiology Fellow was notified who performed a bedside
ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a significant
pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology.  The
family was immediately apprised of the situation, and was
presented with the options of pursuing a decompression of the
pericardial effusion or pursuing a course of conservative
management, given the grim prognosis of the patient's
esophageal cancer.  The patient's oncologist was also
[**Name (NI) 653**], who had seen the patient earlier in the day.  He
felt that the patient's family was aware of all the facts
concerning the prognosis and was capable of making a wise
decision about the patient's further care. Upon further
discussion with the family, it was decided to withdrawal care
and provide supportive care only.  Because of this,
decompression of the pericardial effusion was not pursued,
and pressure support was withdrawn.  Approximately five
minutes after withdrawing suppressor support, the patient
went into full cardiac and then respiratory arrest and was
pronounced dead at approximately 11:10 a.m.  The family was
notified and the medical examiner was [**Name (NI) 653**] who declined
to pursue an autopsy in the case.

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o F w/MMP who was at rehab [**5-24**], noted to have decreased
responsiveness and fingerstick was 25. Given glucagon and oral
glucose, FS improved only to 30 so was sent to [**Location (un) **]. In ED,
was ? hypoxic and had afib with slow ventricular response, so
was admitted. Later that day, she was being transferred from the
bed to commode and her legs buckled, she slid to the ground, and
landed with her legs beneath her. She heard a ""snap"" and had
immediate pain, and xray showed a R intratrochanteric hip fx.
She was seen by [**Location (un) 1957**] there, and the plan (after discussion
between [**Location (un) 1957**] and her primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] was to
proceed with surgery although it is high risk given her
extensive coronary disease.) However, today she was hypotensive
in the 80s/40s with a K of 5.8, so her operation was cancelled
and she was sent to their ICU. She had a central line placed to
monitor CVP, which was 11. She was placed on dopamine with
improvement in her bp to 100s-110s. She was then transferred
here for further evaluation.
.
Her hospital course at [**Location (un) **] was also complicated by
respiratory depression which occurred after receiving 2 mg IV
dilaudid; this responded well to narcan. She also had a UTI
being treated with levofloxacin, persistent diarrhea being
treated as presumed C diff (although c diff negative), and acute
renal failure (creat 1.4 on admission, increased to 2.5 by day
of d/c).

IMAGING:
[**5-26**] AP CXR:
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2148-5-26**] at 18:28. No
prior films are available for comparison. The heart is likely
top normal in size. There is calcification and tortuosity of the
aorta and there are median sternotomy wires present. A
right-sided IJ line is present and it has its tip projected over
the expected location of the SVC. Linear atelectasis or scarring
is seen at the left base. There is no evidence of acute
consolidation or frank failure. There is deformity of the distal
clavicle likely secondary to prior trauma. IMPRESSION: Linear
atelectasis or scarring at the left base. Right-sided IJ line in
satisfactory position.
.
[**5-28**] Hip 2 views: There is an intramedullary rod and a gamma
nail.
.
[**5-30**] Port abd: 1)Limited study which is focused around the
pelvis rather than abdomen. However, no abnormal looking bowel
loop is demonstrated. No obstruction is noted. No
pneumoperitoneum is detected. 2) Status post fracture of the
right femoral neck with dynamic hip screw placement. Fracture
line is still well visualized.
.
[**2148-6-4**] Colonoscopy: Impression: External hemorrhoids, Internal
hemorrhoids; Erythema, friability, congestion and ulceration in
the rectum, compatible with possible inflammation from rectal
tube trauma; Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Recommendations: The rectal inflammation was likely due to
rectal tube trauma. If rectal bleeding persists, a follow-up
flexible sigmoidoscopy should be performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 80 year old woman with CAD, CHF, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, who was admitted with hypotension and a hip
fracture. Her brief hospital course, by problem:
.
# Hypotension: Initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension
briefly requiring dopamine but resolved. Her CVP of 11 not
suggestive of either sepsis, volume depletion, or cardiogenic
shock.  Her leukocytosis is concerning, although may be due to
stress from her hip fracture. Her blood pressure remained stable
on the medicine floor and at the time of discharge, she had been
restarted on her antihypertensive medications.
.
# Bloody bowel movement. Had bloody BM x 2 on [**5-30**], with stable
hematocrit. She went for colonoscopy on [**6-4**], which showed
internal and external hemorrhoids as well as friable/inflammed
rectal mucosa (which was thought likely secondary to rectal
tube). If she continues to have rectal bleeding or pain, she
should have a flexible sigmoidoscopy in 4 weeks.
.
# Hip fracture. Underwent ORIF on [**5-28**], without complications.
She should continue Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for a total of 4 weeks, daily
dressing changes, and physical therapy. Pain control with
Tylenol and oxycodone.
.
# CAD. Given beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, and statin.
.
# ARF: Renal function continued to improve with fluids, thought
pre-renal etiology secondary to third-spacing from the hip
fracture. A foley was in place given a coccygeal ulcer, but this
should be removed when the patient is able to ambulate.
.
# UTI: Urinalysis positive on admission. Treated with
ciprofloxacin x 3 days.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Continued amiodarone.
.
# Diarrhea: Treated empirically at [**Location (un) **] (OSH) for C. diff,
but both C. diff A and B toxins were not detected in assays
here. Flagyl and vancomycin were discontinued. All other
infectious sources were ruled out.
.
# Diabetes: Covered with Humalog sliding scale, restarted Lantus
on [**2148-5-31**] at half home dose (15 units per AM) She was low FS so
this was decreased to 13 units.  Once she restarts on a normal
diet, lantus should be retitrated up.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] a is a 48-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension who presented with 3 days of chest pain associated
with EKG changes and positive troponin. Her brief hospital
course by active problem is as follows:
.
1. STEMI. Although on admission there were no clear EKG changes,
an EKG on the morning of [**12-23**] showed dynamic T wave changes
consistent with transmural infarct. Her CK peaked at 774, and
Troponin T peaked at 1.30. On admission ([**12-21**]), she was stable
and CP free without EKG changes, and so cath was planned for the
following morning. However, on the morning ([**12-22**]) following her
evening transfer from OSH, she began having gross hematemesis.
She was transferred to the CCU and GI performed endoscopy (see
below). She was stabilized, and the next morning ([**12-23**]) her EKG
showed changes, so she was cathed. This revealed extensive
disease in her LAD and 4 stents were placed in this vessel. One
day later, she was called out from the CCU to the floor. She was
treated with heparin and integrillin gtt initially, but these
were stopped with the hematemesis. She was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, metoprolol, and high-dose statin. Her ACE-I was held for
2 days after the cath to prevent renal failure due to a high dye
load. She was restarted on captopril and then transitioned to
lisinopril.  She was discharged on Toprol XL.
.
2. Hematemesis. EGD on [**12-22**] revealed erosions at EG junction
consistent with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. These were too diffuse for
BICAP. Her bleeding nonetheless stopped with PPI [**Hospital1 **] and
carafate. Her Hct dropped only 3 points, and she had no further
bleeding. She required no transfusion.  SHe was discharged on a
daily PPI, to be followed up with PCP.
.
3. CHF. She developed failure during this admission, but was
diuresed with significant improvement in her symptoms and chest
x-ray. Echo on [**12-24**] showed an estimated EF of 50%. She was
given beta-blocker and ACE-I as above.
.
4. Fever. She spiked a fever to 101.1F on the night before her
expected discharge, delaying it by several days. Urinalysis was
clean, chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were pending. WHen
she spiked a fever again on [**12-26**], her sputum grew GPC; she was
started on a 7 day course of levofloxacin for bronchitits /
bronchioloitis.
.
5. Hypertension. This was well-controlled with amlodipine,
metoprolol, and later captopril / lisinopril.
.
6. Physical therapy saw the patient and cleared her to go home
without any services.

Date of Birth:   [**2166-2-11**]       Sex:  M

Service:  NEONATOLOGY

ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The baby is a 38 and [**12-31**]
week, 3110 gram male admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit for management of respiratory distress.  The infant was
born via repeat C section to a 34 year-old G2 P1 now 2 mom,
serologies O positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface
antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, GBS
negative.  Maternal history unremarkable.  Previous pregnancy
notable for a full term female infant admitted to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for mild meconium aspiration
syndrome.  This pregnancy was without issue.  Labor and
Delivery, artificial rupture of membrane at time of delivery.
No maternal fever.  Antepartum antibiotics begun one hour
prior to C section.  Nuchal cord times one.  Apgars 8 and 9.

POST NATAL COURSE:  In the newborn nursing during nursing
assessment the baby turned [**Name2 (NI) 38875**] and came back on his own.
The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was called to evaluate the
infant and subsequently he was transferred to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit for further care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The baby was in mild
respiratory distress.  Anterior fontanel was soft and flat.
Baby was on CPAP and the lungs were clear bilaterally with
poor aeration, positive grunting, negative flaring, negative
retractions.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, no
murmur.  Femoral pulses were equal bilaterally.  Adomen was
soft.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Testes were down bilaterally.
Anus was patent.  No sacral anomalies.  The baby was [**Name2 (NI) **] and
well perfused.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray the baby was expanded to eight ribs.
There were streaky perihilar markings.  Cardiac silhouette
was normal.

The impression at that time was of a full term male newborn
with respiratory distress.  History and chest x-ray suggestive
of TTN.  Must also consider HMD in this 38 week male.
Infection unlikely based on risk factors, though will cover
appropriately.  Will start CPAP titrate FIO2 appropriately and
wean as tolerated.  Will check CBC and blood culture and start
antibiotics for a rule out sepsis.  NPO with maintenance
intravenous fluids.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory:  The baby was on CPAP for a total of 36
hours.  He had a capillary gas on CPAP with a pH of 7.34 and a
CO2 of 44.  He extubated to room air.  Respiratory rates
initially were in the 60s to 100s and subsequently normal in
the 40s to 60s.  The baby was noted to have one apneic spell
with some mild desaturation on the day of birth.  The baby did
not exhibit any more apnea spells this admission, therefore
the initial episode was attributed to transition.  He
transitioned from CPAP to room air on hospital day number two.
 He has remained in room air for a total of 48 hours without
any apneic spells prior to transfer to the Newborn Nursery.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had no cardiovascular issues
this admission.  No hypotension and no murmur.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was NPO
and on intravenous fluids while he was on CPAP.  Once the
baby came off CPAP on hospital day number two the baby was
quickly transitioned to breast feeding and bottle feeding of
breast milk.  The patient's D sticks remained reasonable.
The patient continued to have reasonable urine output and so
we allowed the mother to breast feed po ad lib and the baby
has become better over the last 24 hours at breast feeding.
On top of breast feeding the baby is taking bottle feeds
after breast feeds between 27 and 50 cc.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The baby on hospital day number three
had a total bilirubin of 5.5 significantly less then the
photherapy level.  We will watch clinically at this time.

5.  Infectious disease:  The baby completed a 48 hour rule
out sepsis course on ampicillin and gentamicin.  Blood
cultures were negative at 48 hours therefore the ampicillin
and gentamycin were discontinued.  There were no other issues
this admission.

6.  Hematologic:  The patient had a hematocrit of 48.

7.  Neurological:  With the apneic episode on the day of
birth, there was a question of associated shaking movements.
It was observed by one person and was self limiting.  The baby
did not exhibit any other signs of possible seizure activity
this admission with three days of observation.  He also had no
risk factors for seizure.   No intracranial abnormalities are
suspected at this time.

8.  Renal:  The patient continued to have good urine output
this admission.

9.  Sensory:  Hearing screening was not performed, but should
be performed prior to discharge.  The patient is not at risk
for significant retinopathy and therefore an ophthalmologic
examination is not warranted prior to discharge.

10.  Psycho/social:  The parents are very involved.  The
mother is a pediatric nurse practitioner and has been
involved in the baby's care.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 33-year-old female
with history of left breast cancer.  Had chemotherapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Has a past medical history of
depression and she also presented with a need of prophylactic
mastectomy due to high risk on her right side.  She had
previous surgery on her left breast with biopsy.  She has
wisdom teeth removed and a molar removed, and she has had a
history of laparoscopic surgery.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin.

MEDICATIONS:  The medication that she takes on a daily basis
was Celexa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was otherwise in good health.  She
was supple, no nodes were noted on HEENT examination.  Her
chest was clear, S1, S2.  There was a noted nipple inversion
and a large mass was noted on the left.

IMPRESSION:  Left breast cancer.

PLAN:  Bilateral mastectomies with left axillary dissection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the patient was identified, was taken
to the operating room, and a combined procedure with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 364**], please see operative dictation.  However, [**Location (un) **] and
[**Doctor Last Name 13797**] left [**Last Name (un) 5884**] free flap was performed in which the
vascular anastomosis was hooked into the LIMA and a right
pedicle TRAM flap was performed.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Five hundred cc estimated blood loss, IV
fluids 5400, urine output during the case was 690 cc.
Patient was stable.  Discharged to the Surgical ICU, where
she stayed for 48 hours with frequent flap checks.

Her postoperative hematocrit on day #1 was 28.  However,
after continued the Doppler checks on the left flap and the
capillary refill on the right skin panel were extremely
adequate throughout the duration of her stay in the ICU.
However, the patient remained with persistent tachycardia.
She was bolused and she was given 1 unit of packed red blood
cells.

She continued to do well in the postoperative course and was
transferred after 48 hours to the floor.  Some pain control
issues were present once the patient was switched over from
IV pain medications and switched to oral.  However, after a
minimal amount of time, the patient's pain regimen was
stratified and patient continued to do well with oral pain
medications.  Her diet was advanced as tolerated, and patient
was HEP locked as far as her IV goes.  Her Foley was removed
and she was ambulating frequently on the floor.  However,
throughout the course of this, her flap continued to remain
viable being her pedicle TRAM and her free flap remained with
good Doppler signal.  Good skin color was noted on the skin
paddles.

Patient continued to ambulate under the service of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 364**], general surgeon attending, Medicine consult was
called for persistent tachycardia.  At that juncture, the
consultant recommended that an EKG be performed to rule out a
supraventricular tachycardia.  EKG was performed and it was
determined that the patient was in sinus tachycardia, and it
was deemed that this patient was improving clinically as her
hematocrit did come up to 25.  After 1 unit, she had come up
from a hematocrit of 23.  Patient continued to improve over
the next several days, and it was decided that the patient
had met criteria for discharge.  Patient was given all
instructions and all questions were answered prior to
discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin.
